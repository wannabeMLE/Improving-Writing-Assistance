Unemployment is a difficult statistic.  There was a point in I think 2014 where it dropped a huge amount, and everyone was hailing Obama for creating all sorts of jobs.  In reality, everyone that lost their job back in 2012 was still without one, they just no longer qualified for unemployment insurance (that had been extended a few times to last over 2 years, vs the 1 it normally did).

I think the better indicator is called ""job participation"" or something like that.

I personally make enough to get by, and with my next raise in July will start being able to save much more.  I don't live paycheck to paycheck, but a single emergency woukd drain what I have put away so far.

I could probably get a job that pays more, but would drastically reduce how happy I would be. Being stuck driving a desk as a cog in the meaningless machine would cause my mental health to go off a cliff (probably followed by me shortly after).

"If you don’t like easy to use powerful spray weapons, you definitely shouldn’t like this thing. But I guess since it was underutilized when it was in the game, people have fond memories of it compared to other powerful spray guns.

"Firstly, way to put words in my mouth: I never said fuck matchmaking or ranked mode. Not sure how you got that impression when I specifically said that I acknowledged that Respawn releasing more art, lord and animated trailers won't happen. 

Secondly, don't be so condescending. I know I sound like some teenager (definitely not a teen) since I ship Mirage and Wraith but you don't need to be so rude. I also agree wtth the other commentator below, don't use ""purrfect"" - it's not endearing even when it's used to mock. 

I doubt you'll read my reply but to reiterate I just want more art, character lore and the like. A love story would be appreciated but I know it's not happening.",0
"I probably should have considered that before asking the question. At least it isn't that ""shart shart shart"" abomination they had in the poll a couple years back.",0

"Except they nominated and will probably elect a woman against her will. Isn’t it counter intuitive to force a woman into a position she doesn’t want. Which is better; letting a man who is dedicated to the mission lead or taking the voice away from a woman and putting her in a position she doesn’t want to be in?  
Which one has the better image. Because that’s all you really focused on. Maybe the mission is more important than how the mission is perceived.",0
"It’s always been Sam. His personality suits Captain America so much more. Can you see Bucky being a leader? Can you see him rallying the troops and inspiring others? An icon for the American people?

It’s been set up that way. Notice how Sam is always following Captain America around. He’s always wanted to be an Avenger. You can see this in Avengers 2 when you can detect just a hint of jealously when Sam and Steve are talking.

He doesn’t care if he gets hurt. He’ll always use his time to help others (even before he suited up as the Falcon). He even volunteered himself to join Captain America in returning the stones.

Bucky’s relationship to Steve could be stronger, but it doesn’t mean that he’s meant to be Captain America. Sam is much more of a leader than Bucky and knows the Avengers way more than Bucky anyways.",0

"Definitely been a fun game to watch so far, Barcelona have looked in control and deserve to be leading at half-time. Liverpool haven't created many chances, but there's definitely some sense of danger whenever Salah has the ball on the right-wing. Firmino has definitely been a miss for them going forward considering how much work he usually does. Also, the goal was immense - a world-class ball from Alba and a fantastic finish from Suarez.",0

"""I was useless because I was pyke"" 

Maybe play Pyke in the support role then, ya dingus. Y'know, where he's meant to be played? 

Some future things though: 

Some games are literally just unwinnable no matter how well you do. It's League trying to keep everything fair for people. 

If you want to play an assassin jungler, there's better ones than Pyke. Nocturne, K6, Evelynn, Rengar... maybe even Diana too. Maybe. But yeah, maybe try Rengar (who's kinda similar to Pyke) and see how you get on. 

Your KDA isn't the only measure of success in game. Objectives are arguably better than kills. Also Pyke has an instakill button built into his kit so it's not really surprising that you have multiple kills. 

But yeah, taking objectives is how you win. As a jungler, how many drakes did you take? How many turrets did you help clear? When mid was feeding, did you try to apply pressure somewhere else like top? Why didn't you get Teemo snowballing faster if he had a lead? 

Look at your replay with a critical eye and you'll see where you went wrong.",0
"Yup, but not in Italian pizzas",0
"Lol at Lysa Arryn of Chairs. Gonna steal and say this to people. Most won't understand, but WE'LL understand. Cheers.",0

"I’m sorry, but don’t sit here and act like the pro-gun crowd debates in good faith. It’s kind of ridiculous that you are calling him out for throwing his hands up in disgust. Anytime a shooting happens, all gun owners want to do is push it under the rug and say “don’t politicize a tragedy.” They wait for it to die down until the next murder spree happens. It’s a fucking idiotic cycle we endure so that gun owners don’t have to come to the table and actually discuss regulations.",0
"Lol, yeah, but just for theft and criminal mischief. It’s totally okay to kill someone doing all of those other things at any time of day. Yay Texas!

The next part of the statute says that you can even kill someone FLEEING from doing one of these things (IE shoot them in the back as they run away) if NOT doing so would put you at risk of death/serious bodily injury OR “the land or property cannot be protected or recovered by any other means”",0
"I don't care if it is a possibility, its all just trying to find excuses to allow shitty behavior to continue without push back.",0
"Don’t turn your faucet off. 

It’s overflowing with kitties!",0
"Less than 50% of felons in the US are incarcerated for violent crimes. So until you know more about an individual felon it's a toss up whether they are or are not really bad people. The fact that these guys in particular are in for violent crimes doesn't change that. 

Thus, if only given this video to watch it's presumptuous to assume he's a truly bad person. (Albeit if he's guilty of his accused crimes he obviously is, in hindsight)",0

"While I absolutely stand by this woman, personally as a gun owner and someone who packs heat daily I absolutely live by the rule that I will avoid using that tool unless my life or someone else's life is in danger. I will watch with my weapon pointed at you as you peacefully steal my shit before I pull that trigger. 

It unnerves me that she rushed home to confront him and then shot him as he was climbing OUT of the window. You're just asking for manslaughter charges.",0
"I was surprised too. Im also pretty disgusted because her nose isn’t even big or crooked or anything, her nose is completely fine, she just wants it smaller because she’s photoshopped her pictures that way and thinks it looks better.",0

"To be honest, if you cannot seem to get past it then you have a problem with him being promiscuous and I’m here to tell you that’s completely okay. Yes, this is his past and not his future. Yes, it shouldn’t matter because it was before you. But you’re not a bad person for having preferences or not understanding the ability to sleep with that many people. Personally for me, 300 girls is a dealbreaker no matter what. I don’t prefer people who have been that promiscuous because I value sex and I think of it as something special, I can only have sex with people if I’m emotionally connected to them. So I wouldn’t date someone with that number, I probably wouldn’t date someone with a number over 20 or so. You don’t have to get over it. If you can see past it, great. But if you can’t, that’s your personal preference and you’re allowed to have those especially if you don’t judge or think of him as any less because of his number.",0

Yea and I'm saying during a chaotic battle like that it's unlikely to accidentally separate by gender. It doesn't make me hate the scene and I can still appreciate it for what it is. I just think saying that scene was forced is a fair critisism of a great movie. I don't think anyone reasonable is mad because Marvel has badass girls. Scarlett Witch fighting Thanos was one of the best  scenes! They're upset because the scene felt political and kinda pulls you out of the movie.,0

It would give Wukong players ways to farm and trade without committing to melee range combat with champs like riven/jax/etc. As it currenlty stands, Wu is impossible to mess up which means riot has to balance around how easy it is for him to kill people.

"Lyanna Mormont pretty much spits in Jon and Sansas face until the Onion Knight does his fatherly thing and she keeps faith with the Starks.

Sansa wins the BOTB. The Vale is there for her.

Jorah convinces Jon to take on the BWB at Eastwatch after recognising Thoros (they were the first two through the walls at Pyke)
Gendry was trashing them only a second beforehand and Jon recognises the hound as an enemy. 
If Jorah wasn’t there Jon probably leaves them. 
The reason they’re at Eastwatch is a mixture of Berrics leadership and the Hounds visions. 

The hound was also loyal to Arya long before he even knew who Jon was.

Dany and everything that comes with her was Jon though.

There is no way she should have stood against Brienne who has been training her whole life in typical combat.

And it was really cheesy seeing her spin around like Darth Maul killing all those wights.  Wights are not supposed to be easy kills and will swarm anyone they see.

Brienne is a far better character which conveys a similar message. She reminds me of a girl I went to high school with who was the first in the local division to play full-contact football with the guys (a privilege she had to fight for). I bought into Brienne's character from day one.

"[Chomsky talks about this fantasy of ""free markets"" vs Capitalism as it's really practiced.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5obtpWrFKjU)

I recommend watching at 1.5x, but Chomsky points out the notion of risk, and how industries never shoulder the consequences of their business failures, but instead rely on socialism and the nanny state to protect them from their losses. 

This assumes, however, that the business has established itself, and that the founder successfully did that. The question then becomes: does that success entitle the CEO to insanely high levels of pay once the risk is abated? Since the risk of failure is gone once established (and gained the protection of the nanny state), the only risk is during the initial stages. Okay, fine, let's grant this. But what about after the risk period and after the initial investment has been recouped? [Check out this blog on that line of reasoning.](http://dbzer0.com/blog/the-risk-in-capitalism-is-nothing-more-than-a-scare-tactic/)

tl;dr: CEOs might validly claim to make more because of risk, but only for as long as it takes to recover the initial investment. Risk of failure is highly mitigated by the state once the business is established, and therefore doesn't justify such high levels of pay.",0

"My boyfriend and I befriended a kid in high school who was in an electric wheelchair. We didn’t know why and he never really talked about it. He was in the special needs class so we figured he was paralyzed. 

Sometimes we wouldn’t see him because his teacher wouldn’t let him outside during our lunch time but we would wait for him anyway and be happy the days he was there. He would be waiting for us at the special needs building and we’d run over to meet him (these kids mostly had to stay in their own area and had lunch at a different time. So I think he wasn’t even supposed to be outside). 

He was hilarious and fun and would ask us to jump on and take us for a ride on his wheelchair and we had a lot of fun listening to music and laughing behind the building. He talked about how he didn’t have friends in the special needs class that he could talk to because he wasn’t special needs in that way. And we didn’t really get the other kids so it perfect. 

One day randomly while hanging out he says “you know I’m gonna die soon” This was his sort of humor and we thought he was joking so we told him “no you won’t” and he said “you’re right” and we all laughed and carried on. He had never let on that he was sick and he didn’t look it either.

&gt; Japan&amp;#039;s new Emperor Naruhito is set to formally mark his ascension to the Chrysanthemum throne on Wednesday, a day after his father became the first emperor to abdicate in two centuries.

&gt; &amp;quot;In 1989 when Akihito , he spoke about social welfare and peace,&amp;quot; Ken Ruoff, director at the Centre for Japanese Studies at Portland State University, told the BBC. These were goals that Emperor Akihito worked towards during his Heisei era, and his interactions with those stricken by disease or disaster endeared him to many Japanese.

&gt; Emperor Akihito took up the role of a diplomat during his reign, becoming an unofficial ambassador for Japan and travelling extensively to other countries, - something Naruhito is expected to continue.

"Well I'm certainly not lying. It's in the article. Along with this quote, “After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller’s letter, he called him to discuss it,” a Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday evening. “In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel’s obstruction analysis. They then discussed whether additional context from the report would be helpful and could be quickly released.""",0
"Games are in a unique position because they are interactive, where a player is an active participant in the action on-screen. This interactivity means that a variety of different players are going to take part in different ways, be it their preferred play style, their skill level and even things like freedom to enjoy the game in day-to-day life; all of which will have an impact on whether or not someone believes in the argument for an easy mode in a game like Sekiro or even the way some people view topics like microtransactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think the easy mode debate boils down to the type of game that's being created. From Software design games specifically to be challenging to the player, so adding an easy mode would pretty much defeat the point of their game as an artistic creation. The same way adding a ""skip"" button in a puzzle game defeats the point there. Sure it could be nice for those who just want to experience the story, but there are thousands of games out there which also have great stories to experience.  I personally wouldn't go watch a movie which I know isn't for me. Or read a book that I know I'm not going to  enjoy. The same way that I don't usually go out of my way to play games that aren't for me (sometimes I do for review purposes). Case in point, I haven't played From Software games other than the first Dark Souls because I don't really enjoy the type of challenge it provides, same way I don't play rage games. It's just not for me personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Would I like to play them to experience the worlds of these games etc? Yeah, I would and I probably will sit down and play through them to experience it at some point, probably gritting my teeth in frustration as I do. I don't expect or want them to change their vision for me though. They make games they want to make and they make them well, if those games aren't for me, well it's not like there isn't plenty of other titles for me to experience out there first.

&amp;#x200B;

What I think is the important discussion though, is accessibility options. Giving options to players to balance out the game for those who otherwise could not experience it, be it due to disability or whatever it may be, that is far more of a necessity in my eyes than creating easy modes for games which aren't designed to have them. Games are a great medium and making it so more people can experience them in the way they are meant to be experienced is a great thing that can and should be in developers minds. Letting a player experience a game like Sekiro or Souls at the difficulty of the average player, so they can make their own decision like the rest of us, is a better place to focus in my opinion.",0

"yeah the middle act I felt just elongated the inevitable, the final battle sequence.

Thanos with 5 stones then has to fight against a buffed up Scarlett witch with the mind stone or thanos has 4 stones and its him vs witch + captain marvel with one stone each. too many possibilities and they just dragged 1-1.5 hours on a neatly bow-tied time travel second act.

And I actually agree with you, static models of where the enemies **were** when you used the scan isn't very helpful and can be distracting to teammates. But imagine seeing moving, live silhouettes of the enemies through walls for 3 seconds? Wouldn't that be kinda nice?

"My thoughts exactly. 

People say “She betrayed her family. She did not side with Arya when the butcher boy got killed. She convinced Ned to accept treason charges. Arya would not have done any of it. Arya would've defied the Lannisters. She did not trust Jon.”

She could not help the butcher boy because she was supposed to marry the king's son. She has to stand by him however right or wrong he is. This is exactly what Ned told Arya when she asked why he's allowing this marriage (S1 E2/E3). Thing is you can't say no to the king. It is that simple.

She convinced Ned to accept the charges because Cercei promised her he'll be pardoned. Nobody knew what Joffrey would do, not even Cercei. She had hope for Ned’s life.

Arya would've defied the Lannisters. True. But it would also have resulted in her head on a spike. How does that help? And every person is different. You can't expect everyone to act like Arya or Lyanna Mormont.

“She did not trust Jon.” Well she never had a good relationship with Jon. And after going through all those horrible things, being betrayed by every person that was close to her, who would trust anyone but oneself? 

And about her importance in the story - Not counting Bran, which of the surviving Starks are politicians? Arya’s a fighter, probably one of the best, but a lone wolf, not a leader. Jon’s a fighter, a leader, but a reluctant King. He needs an advisor, a policy maker, a politician, a Hand. Who better than Sansa? She has unironically ‘trained’ under Cercei and Littlefinger. She understands people way more than anyone in the story right now. And has managed the North well for quite some time now. Jon needs her, Winterfell needs her, the North needs her.",0

""I**sn’t this Communism/Socialism?""**

""No. Communism is, by definition, a revolutionary movement to create a classless, moneyless, and stateless social order built upon shared ownership of production. With Socialism, the core principle is the nationalization of the means of production – i.e. the government seizes Amazon and Google. UBI is none of those things and actually fits so seamlessly into capitalism, it is projected to [grow the economy](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Modeling-the-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-a-Universal-Basic-Income.pdf) $2.5 trillion in eight years.

Really, UBI is necessary for the continuation of capitalism through the automation wave and displacement of workers. Markets need consumers to sell things to. Universal Basic Income is capitalism with a floor that people cannot fall beneath.""

But if your wife knew about this beforehand then ESH for not having this conversation with you to let you know what's up.   


If this was your son and you caught him jacking off or found evidence of it, I doubt you'd ground him. Probably have a discussion of boundaries or that he would need to learn how to clean up after himself. It's expected for boys to masturbate. Young pre-teen girls have a wank too. You've probably haven't read women's stories about how they first started to masturbate. I've heard of girls using all kinds of stuff. Vibrating tooth brushes. Hairbrush handles, pillows (to hump), sitting on the washing machine, various vegetables, you name it. I personally used a $14 wall plug in sports muscle massager (as an external toy) when I was young.   


Just like boys, girls will find a way to get off.  It's safer for your kid to explore using toys designed for that purpose vs items she finds laying around your home.   


I can't tell if your wife knew about this and had this discussion with your daughter before she was surfing the net for sex toys or not. If she was aware, she should have let you know this was happening in case you found the thing or... like what actually happened.   


BTW in defense of boys. There are plenty of stories on Reddit of young men using everything from couch cushions to coconuts to nut into. I'd rather the kid masturbate into something that can be cleaned easily vs (again) using shit he finds around the home.",0

Here is an Easter Egg of just one example of Ramin Djawdi's Musical genius:

If  you go back to exactly 1:11 you'll find Theon and Braun the last alive  of the Iron Born and exactly at that moment we go from seeing the face  of death (Night King) pans to Theon's face and Braun's voice saying  'Theon' at the exact same time begins a Musical Quotation that says so  much and is so subtle it might not even be there as I feel like a  conspiracy theorist for pointing out.

The  quotation comes from the introduction to the iconic American Jazz  standard by George fucking Gershwin's 'Summertime' and the living is  easy...as a music major this is magnificent foreshadowing of hope. The  theme Summertime is implying in my opinion that Braun knows Theon's  sacrifice is not in vane. That Summertime is just around the corner with  sweat release of Arya's blade.

Braun: 'Theon...your a good man...thank you'

Could be compared to the comforting line from Summertime...

'So hush little baby, don't you cry' as Theon rallies is courage to charge at the face of death.

"&gt;They drove around to McDonald's and harassed a worker who was African-America through the drive thru window.

That is a legal issue, not a school issue.  Denying someone access to public education for off campus crimes is not legal, and would be a dangerous precedent to set.  In fact, based on Chicago crime stats it would disproportionately effect students of color.

&gt;It's not a huge leap to think it's entirely possible

Yes it is.  We can't punish people for what might happen.  If that is the case, we can go from there.  Staging an entire protest on assumption is just absurd.  

&gt;One student was expelled a few years ago over this, and his family sued the city in court over ""first amendment rights"" and the court agreed with the school.  

Every case like this that I have come across was a direct threat.  If you can show me something different, I would reevaluate my stance.  The student I have heard speak on this claim ""if this had been a black student it would have been handled differently"".  I am fairly certain that there are plenty of students, from every ethnic background and race, with criminal records, who have received no punishment for off school crimes, no matter how heinous.  That's because it is how they system workes.  Schools are not courts 

&gt;School should be preparing students for life in the real world, and in the real world there are consequences for things you do and say.

Socially, yes.  Legally no.  They should also be showing students that there are direct concequences to drug use, violent crime, theft, etc.  To suggest that this is the role of schools and not courts is flat out BAD.  In no way should we deny people education for out of school crime.  Again, this would disproportionately effect youth of color.  We should not dictate laws through the educational system.  We also shouldn't decide which laws are okay to break by students based on your personal barometer or what's not okay today.  

&gt;This is real world action here.

You clearly don't understand the difference between the government and private industry, your friend, Facebook, Twitter can do what they want as far as banning unpopular speech.  I never suggested otherwise.  The government cannot, in any way shape or form, no matter how offended you are.

At no point did I suggest there should be no social ramifications for thier actions.  They will and should be outcast from social groups, removed from team sports.  These images should be pulled from social media.  What shouldn't be done is the government putting any barrier between children and education.  I feel like physical assault is a far greater crime than blackface;  how many people would be prevented from accessing education if we expelled everyone who commited assault off campus?   As stated before, this would be an expellable offense at a private school, public schools have a duty to make sure all students have access to education.  That doesn't only apply to students who aren't assholes.  Criminals are dealt with by the legal system not the school system.  Protesting the schools to punish them is as effective as protesting the courts to lock someone up for using racial slurs.  It would be completely unenforceable and defended to the end by the ACLU.  Any concession of free speech to a government entity is dangerous because in 20 years, your ideas might be unpopular.",0

"&gt;	And there it is, because casuals care more about looks than context and it's the same reason why poeple ship Drogo &amp; Daenerys still. They just think of Jason instead of the actual character.

It’s not the same at all... Yes, Drogo was hot, but he was also a cruel, pillaging, murdering rapist, who basically only “loved” Dany because... she introduced cowgirl style to him and promised she would give birth to a boy who will conquer the world? Meanwhile, Jorah in the show was actually a good person, and has been Dany’s best protector and advisor and closest friend, often the only one she could be herself around and show her vulnerability, many of her most emotional scenes were with Jorah. And we could see their relationship develop for 8 years, and survive extreme challenges (like his betrayal coming to light, and him keeping coming back and staying alive against all odds). Nobody’s shipping Jorah with Dany in the show just because show Jorah is hot. I’m pretty sure people who shipped her with Drogo are not the same people who shipped her with Jorah, since those two characters and their relationships with Dany are almost polar opposites.

&gt;	Just because people have chemistry doesn't mean that it's sexual chemistry and it never comes across as such in the show.

The kind of chemistry I’m talking about can’t be “intended”, it either is or there isn’t. Sometimes the characters that are suppsed to be in love with each other fail to come across as in love convincingly enough, and sometimes characters who aren’t supposed to fall love look and act as if they‘re just about to (and this is exactly why fan shipping exists). For example, Jon and Dany’s relationship just didn’t sell to me most of the time, especially this season. I think Emilia is able to sell it quite well at times, but not Kit. He seemed to do much better with Rose, although maybe not surprising since he was actually in love with her in real life and it might feel awkward to him with Emilia. I’ve been avoiding rewatching Jon’s scenes with Ygritte because they make it significantly harder to take Jonerys seriously, and I do want to take it seriously.

Meanwhile, Iain Glen is a really strong actor who has chemistry with just about everyone he’s been on screen with, but it’s top notch with Dany, you can clearly see love in his face every time he looks at her, while he still manages to look stoic and dignified. And Dany clearly loves him too, more than anyone else, even if not romantically. And when Dany keeps caressing and kissing his face and holding hands with him all the time, is it really so strange that people are imagining them together?

I don’t get why people care so much about who other people ship some characters with, though.",0

THEN Thanos' side respawns all the way across from the Avangers and the stones where they spawn and are able to just fly into the stones.

There is no reward for killing Avengers since they just respawn and fly right to the same stones.

Thanos is slow and clunky as all living hell.

Can't even complete this last challenge because of how poorly thought out Thanos' side vs. Avengers was.

Even if you can grab 5 stones, the last one is almost impossible to grab as you'll be constantly blasted with Iron Man BS. And building does absolutely nothing which makes me wonder why you regain materials over time?

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

Last weekend my girlfriend and I went to the movies. Originally we planned on seeing a horror movie, turns out we couldn’t get it because we aren’t old enough(We are both 17).
The movie clerk suggests a couple movies to us and seeing as our options have dwindle down, I buy tickets for another movie that was PG-13. To be blunt, I could care less what movie we saw, I know it sounds corny but as long as I’m with her that’s all that matters. 

After the movie was over she expressed how she was disappointed and annoyed that I didn’t express any anger after realizing we couldn’t see the movie we wanted to watch. I kind of brushed it off because it seemed absurd to get mad over something so silly. 

But she wasn’t done, she then started yelling at me, stating that I never show her enough emotion and how she’s never seen me angry or sad and that it worries her. “Can you just fucking tell me what’s going on in your mind”

The current theory is that giant and colossal squids are actually really lethargic creatures that just hang still in the water until something bumps into their tentacles.

Sperm whales most likely hunt them by hitting them with a sonic blast like a flash-bang grenade before slamming into them. The squids instinctively wrap their tentacles around the whale's head which causes the scarring but they don't stand a chance really.",0

Venezualas election system is one of the most rigorous in the world, a better quality than in the states apparently, they are triple verified (finger prints, ID, random recounts). I noticed that when some talking head tries to dismiss the democratic choice of that country they just mutter ""stuffed ballots"" and move on, without giving any details about what they know, what evidence they have to allege this, what investigation or report are they referring to. 

The sad fact is, Venezuala is a South American country and it's people are mostly brown, everyone in the West accepts allegations it's electoral procedures are crappy because it's clicks right in to their expectations. But put it this way, if your nation has as much history with your politics being messed with as Venezuala does, then you design your system to be as hard to fuck with as you can, and they have. Provide detail of these 'ballot stuffing' accusations or getdafuck.

I blame the Usual Suspects because they've had previous, and frankly they don't even try to hide what they do, they boast of it. In fact I don't understand what kind of fuckwit would look at the sanctions, at Obamas designating Venezuala an existential threat to the United States, at that death-squad hobgoblin of theirs being rolled out and sicced on the country, and still expect people to believe the US is just a concerned onlooker or something. I think you just don't know what the US gets up to down there. There is a universe of ways in which the United States can fuck with a country like Venezuala, and they are.

"Reagan single handedly destroyed America and shaped it to what it is today. He swung the political spectrum so far right that what is left today was considered right wing in the 1970s. 

Domestically, he normalized Barry Goldwater’s mentality of anti-government sentiment. His words “The most dangerous words in the English language are: I am from the government, and I’m here to help” defined what the Republican party and its followers are today. Voters fell for his charisma and grandfather-persona, leading to 2+ generations of major distrust for the government, the idea that Christianity and politics are required to have a functioning government, and taxes are the closest thing to the devil as you’ll get. In the meantime, while he presented himself as an American savior of the burdened via his war against the Soviet Union, he slipped Reaganomics through and his followers followed like sheep. Cut taxes to the rich, expecting investments in return. What a crock of shit. Even Daddy Bush called it Voodoo Economics because of how absurd it was. 

Foreign-wise, his Iran-Contra Affair lead to the creation of the Islamic-extremist groups that carry out terrorist attacks worldwide. His administration single-handedly supplied weapons to the Mujahideen from Afghanistan in the 1980s, the same group of “freedom fighters against the Godless Commies” who would evolve into world-renown terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, the group responsible for September 11 on AMERICAN soil. 

All this, for lesser taxes on rich goons, and the Red Scare paranoia.

From the article

&gt;But days after the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting, she was disturbed by their campaigning in support of then-Republican gubernatorial candidate, Ron DeSantis. Shoup, who identifies as Jewish, felt that their material and remarks affected her and seeing the assault rifle flag was her tipping point.   
&gt;  
&gt;Shoup said that her pro-Palestine stance made her not as welcomed and accepted by the Jewish community on campus and that she didn't feel able to process within the community or with a rabbi.   
&gt;  
&gt;Judge is the student that had the milk thrown on her and currently serves as the vice-membership chair of the College Republicans. She said that day they were tabling to raise awareness of their club to get more people to join.     
&gt;  
&gt;“I finally asked her to leave and she left, and she kicked down our sign as she left...” Judge said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Immediately after the incident, Judge didn’t know how to respond because of shock.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When I was out there in the moment, one of my friends came up to me and was like ‘You need to call the police to report this because it’s not okay what happened,'” Judge said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The FSU Police Department asked Shoup to come in for questioning, and she later found out there was a warrant for her arrest. She went into the station, they handcuffed her and she spent the night in jail.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shoup said there was a long process that she had to go through after charges were pressed. She had to do an anger management evaluation with the University Counseling Center, write an essay, make a lesson plan, pay a fee and complete 15 hours of community service. The charges against Shoup were eventually dropped.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shoup said that although she doesn’t want to absolve herself, and that what she did was definitely aggressive, there’s a worldly context that she considers.  
&gt;  
&gt;“In comparison to the violence of incarceration, and the violence of being doxxed by antisemites, and the violence of walking on campus and listening to an evangelical Christian preacher telling me that I’m a heathen, going to hell,” Shoup said. “I guess when you put it into context it kind of pales in comparison to a lot of violence that marginalized people face because of the historical moment that we’re living in.”

&gt;The College of Democrats also issued one denouncing the actions of Shoup, even though she was not affiliated.",0

It sounds like she’s just wanting some attention. (before everyone loses it on me let me finish) She is not feeling validated by her husband at home, and is probably extremely insecure. She just needs someone to care about her. I know hypochondriacs can be super annoying and I have several in my own family, and encouraging the behavior and thought loops makes them realize it’s an effective way of getting attention. BUT, she is not being supported at home so try your hardest to be there for her, but at the end of the day it’s not your issue to deal with if you don’t want to.",0
"I was just thinking about the difference in costumes. I was picturing, in my head, one of Wonder Womans ""epic"" moments.

Scheming characters are responsible for beginning the needless war, fragmenting the realm, and lowering the chances of humanity’s survival overall.

"Former EMT here- This wasn't last words spoken, but last words written. While I was working in a rural community in Canada when there was a string of girls the ages of 11-15 that committed suicide (believed to be a pact). One night we went to a call for a possible suicide attempt (pills). Upon arrival, we found an unconscious 16-year-old girl with a name written all over her body in black marker. Come to find out the name was her sisters who was one of the girls who had committed suicide. She made it to the hospital and was flown out to a larger center but ended up passing away.

Maybe I’m the asshole for realizing people make mistakes and she’s only human.",0
"True, there are definitely things simulations can't account for. But say you're not a greenhorn and instead are, for example, a well-trained squad running a Bin Laden-like raid. Even better, say we know the compound layout in advance and can incorporate that into the simulation. Now say you have the time to run that simulation dozens of times with your squad before the real deal. The training implications there are pretty interesting.",0

"So just putting in my two cents here -- I am very egalitarian in my relationship. We split bills 50/50, I've always paid a portion of dates (we usually split by activity rather than down the middle), I think Valentine's Day is about BOTH the man and woman (and get my fiance an equal amount of gifts he gets me) and every birthday/anniversary has a gift minimum/limit so we're equal. Your friends may appear the same way.

BUT BUT BUT... if a man didn't pay for the FIRST date and first date only, there would be no second date. I don't know why it's important to me, but it sets a nice tone imo.

On our first date my fiance paid for our drinks and comedy tickets entirely. We were 19 and he had run out of money for the evening by the time I wanted a second round of drinks (after spending like $70) so I had NO PROBLEM paying for both our drinks after because he showed the intent was there. But I can't explain why -- to me, it's the right thing to do on a first date. I have never, however, used dates for free food and I carried money on me and did offer to pay. My fiance is one of two people I've ever dated, and the only serious relationship I've ever been in (5 years now). So you could have friends like me and never even know it haha",0

Everyone here always assumes that she's the one to go bad, but that's not satisfying. Not in the show, at least - books seem much more open to me.

Eg, set up a situation where Jon chooses his family and the throne over Dany, or something. A situation where we can understand and empathize with both sides.

Or a mistake, as well. There are some convinced Dany will burn down king's landing - deliberately that seems very unlikely. But by accident? Eg, Dany goes to burn down the red keep to kill Cersei, which wouldn't harm the population. After she's gone, Jaime runs up and tells Jon about the wildfire. He races off to stop Dany, there's a misunderstanding, they fight on dragonback. That's far more interesting/fitting, if tragic, than a contrived Jon good, Dany bad imo.",0

its none of her business why her dad/step mom broke up. just like its none of my business why my parents divorced or why either of them divorced their next marriage. 

I think it was a pretty fucked up petty revenge. there's no other reason for it. she didn't have to lie she could have just said ""that's between me and your father and we can talk about it someday when you're older if you want"" 

that's the respectful thing to do. its the guys 12 year old daughter. its not right to fuck with their relationship because she's upset about how hers didn't work out. when the daughter is older and can process it as an adult then fine share what you'd like to share. but that's just wrong to do to a 12 year old.

" I’ve learned over time  is everybody is rich to somebody. 

My definitions would be 
.1% - money will never run out. They care about $100 more than a poor person. I’ve never seen cheaper people in my life than the Uber wealth. 

Rich - Stupid amounts of money, probably earns 1 mil plus a year but a few bad years and their lifestyle could bring them down quickly. Has all the investments maxed out, Vacations many times a year, buys anything they want. Does not give af about $100

Upper Middle Class - Doesn’t worry about money, can’t spend or buy everything but does a lot. Probably buys a stupid car they don’t need (ahem). Has some investments and children college funds saved. Takes multi vacations a year. Losing $100 is probably a regular occurrence through dumb purchases. $100 will not alter their life at all. 

Middle class - I would say same as above but has to budget pretty well to achieve it. Vacations once or twice a year. Doesn’t buy a stupid car. Losing $100 is frustrating but wouldn’t change their life. 

Working class - Budgets extremely well, if they’re responsible they have emergency fund, they have some small savings doesn’t live paycheck to paycheck but can’t afford a whole lot of luxuries or deviations from the budget. May have some debt they’re paying  off.  Losing $100 would be annoying and probably stop you doing a particular thing but you’d recover ok. 

Poor - paycheck to paycheck, stuck in the viscous cycle of having no money. Probably has debt, no savings, worries about money all the time, has to work multiple jobs and probably still can’t make ends meet. Losing $100 could be the difference between eating or not for the family for a while.",0

Yeah, that is literally the point I was making.  She was following visions, and her actions did not need to be directly related to the end result for her actions to be meaningful.  She wasn't a plot cheat sheet.  She was *part of the plot*.

The arcs were not subverted because they ended in unexpected places, or just for the sake of misdirection.  They were just not going where you thought they were and you need to rectify that on your own.

"Yeah. I think so too. 

I’m not a toxic player simply because it’s limited to text chat. Otherwise I might have a few restrictions under my belt lol. 

I have the unpopular opinion that simple trash talking or harsh criticizing/blaming is fine for the game. Not healthy or unhealthy. Draw the line at personal insults, spam or racial slurs and the such. 

When you’re in the setting of a competitive game where you’re stuck with players who are putting you down then it should be okay to talk trash as long as what happens in each game stays there. 

Maybe I’m thick skinned though. 

To appeal to a bigger playerbase Riot doesn’t want to deter children who are naturally thin skinned from playing. So it makes sense to combat toxicity the way they do. I used to play Call of Duty. Trash talk and raging was fine for the game because it was rated M and children shouldn’t be playing it.",0

It bothers me a great deal that legalistic Christians take John 3:16 so literally. Maybe they’re correct, I don’t know.  

What I do know is that before my five year old sister died, she said that Jesus had come to her the night before and told her he was going to take her home soon. He said for her not to be afraid and promised to care for the rest of us (our family) while we mourned her.  She said she wanted a black cake for her last birthday because it was the color of her Bible.

When my mother died, she said, “I’m ready Jesus. Take me in your arms.”   It was beautiful. 

The odd one was my aunt. For a week or so before she went, she kept asking who all those people were in her room.    I thought loved ones came to help us to the other side sometimes but she didn’t seem to know these people.

JFK Ground controller trying to find out what taxiway the Etihad was using to enter the ramp (area around the terminal where planes park at the passenger gates) but the pilot couldn't understand him. Controllers at NYC airports are notorious for being delightful pricks, and  their New York accents are sometimes hard for foreign pilots to decypher on the radio
6. American Airlines plane wanted to land on JFK's Runway 22 using the localizer (a radio signal that pilots use to tell if they're horizontally lined up with the runway, vital in poor weather and low visibility) but it wasn't functioning. The pilot wanted to instead land on a different runway (31R) and threatened to declare an emergency if the controller refused. The controller pays no attention to the pilot's posturing, so the pilot declares an emergency. When a plane declares an emergency, they more-or-less can navigate where they want, and it's up to the controller to clear the airspace around him",0

Captain also married carter  
I guess they returned Mjoliner quick enough, but how did they repair Captains shield?  
Infinity war also never happened if prior to it, thanos traveled fwd in time and was killed? or what exactly did the snap do?  
Past Nebula was also killed and didn't exist for IW, prior to the snap.  
**What happened w/ Loki and the Tesseract?**

I didn't pee through all of that... They said they had to return things at the ""exact moment"" so did Cap go back and fix that somehow too? (I thought there would be a post credit scene explaining this)

Why can't they time travel to save Iron man now? Or just use the stones again before sending them back.

And now, in all future marvel movies, how are they not going to just ""meh, we can time travel to fix it later, no biggy"" (Harry potter problem, they forget about the time turner)

"The momentum of a pendulum doesn't swing half way.

What I mean by that is the more we try to crack down on non-pc language, the more the detractors of the PC movement will rise up with fucked up comments, and vice versa.

Again, what *actually* happened is irrelevant. Trump unambiguously claims at least two things before he says there were ""very find people on both sides""

1. That the protest of the statue removal was made up of nazis/white supremicists, and people who were NOT nazis or white supremacists. 

2. The nazis/white supremacists should be condemned TOTALLY and he's NOT talking about them.


Both of these facts are not debatable and are crystal clear in the quote.

"OH Mueller wrote a letter to the DOJ stating Barr's memo [“did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-wrote-to-barr-expressing-concern-about-his-presentation-of-investigations-conclusions-wapo)
 of his report for funnzys. got it. 

Muller further details “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation,” he continued. “This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”

and your quoting the DOJ that Mueller is literally calling out for taking taking his own report outta context and confusing the public... lol some galaxy brain takes right there",0
What makes one think think Valyrian steel would and could kill him just because it could kill WW? Using D&amp;D's logic if all of a sudden dragon fire which is what's used to create Valyrian steel does nothing to him coz the viewer didn't have any reason to believe either or why should this? The problem with this entire route to resolution is that we fucking don't know ANYTHING about him which is the fucking problem. They say he had to be stabbed in the same place which only happened coz she screamed to alert and was caught and then forced to do the knife switch.

Maduro is a shitty leader but as Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Iraq have proved of the last two decades a shitty leader is better than a failed state and a civil war.

"&gt;  I've just never seen Republicans on reddit complaining... Never seem a Pro republican article calling for impeachment

wtf? They have the power now, so why would should we expect them to call for impeachment? They certainly were back in the Obama years. 

&gt; it's embarrassing they're still pushing the Trump colluded with Russia crap

The (credible) people pushing the Trump collusion theory are not claiming there was a direct agreement, but a *tacit* one. An unspoken agreement to cooperate, which almost certainly occurred, would fall beyond the scope of the Mueller investigation and the criminal standards of evidence, but would be an easily impeachable offense for a president, especially if it was hidden from the public. Note that Mueller admitted part of the reason he ""did not establish"" evidence of a conspiracy was because nearly everyone on that side of the investigation lied or hid evidence. Mueller also did not investigate Trump's finances, so we don't even know to what extent Trump is involved with Russian financial crimes.

This is why Democrats (and Mueller) were upset about Barr's letter. It lacked context and led the public and otherwise uninformed people (such as yourself) to be deceived by the media headlines into thinking the issue was settled. As Mueller noted, his investigation was primarily to preserve evidence for Congress to investigate further, and come to it's own decision on impeachment.",0

The original crowd simply gets overshadowed by people that don't understand what made the medium stick out in the first place.

"I certainly don’t want expanded Chinese or Russian influence in the hemisphere.

But if the US essentially does help install Guaido—politically and/or militarily—I wonder how long it will be before the cycle repeats itself, with multiple factions fighting/a power vacuum. And then the US will have to spend more blood and/or treasure just to keep things stable there, with lots of pressure to stay to “help clean up the mess” it created.

 I agree Maduro is awful, a dictator. If Guaido *is* the guy to stop Maduro *and* establish a better relationship with the US, then I think that should happen *wholly* through Venezuelan efforts; otherwise, the US is just committing itself, its blood, and its treasure to further entanglements from which it can’t extricate itself without causing some further harm, just as we’ve seen with nation-building or regime-changing in the past.

Edit: Not even through “wholly Venezuelan” efforts—I think it would be fantastic if *South America* helped Venezuela put forth those efforts. At least their interests are more proximate than ours and they could deal with any unforeseen post-Maduro entanglements more easily.",0

As for your sister being only 17 in the pictures: Some people are ready for sex at 14, and some people are 23. The exact age 18 isn’t magical. (Where I’m from, the age for consent is 16. I’m very aware of this, because my daughter turns 16 soon, haha!)

Final note: I wouldn’t end my marriage if I caught my wife masturbating to pictures of my brother. I wouldn’t like that she’s doing it, but ending our marriage over it would be an extreme overreaction (in my opinion). But I’m a very sex-positive person, so my deal breakers will be different than yours. Yours are totally allowed to be different than mine.",0

"Do the laymen talk about quantum physics  without sufficient training? Almost always no.

So why do people who have not undergone training in economics think their opinions are better than Friedman's? And people will support the uneducated layman positing that their opinion is right and Friedman's is wrong.

A townhall meeting only emboldens the laymen in thinking that they now understand economics. Economics today is literally applied mathematics; it's hardly qualitative.

But using your hypothetical situation, I would protest, because that's my god given right as an american (just like MLK, not comparing myself to Dr. King just saying I would protest like him if it was my right. But then again this is Nazi Germany so they have laws against that. So, yes I guess I would fight a foreign government that took over my country) But beyond that, I am cool with dissent man. As an American that is one of our defining characteristics. With Freedom of Speech, anyone can criticize the US government and right now it needs tons of work. However, that doesnt give you the right to kill innocent people and send bombs to unsuspecting government employees. Killing people for believing in something different is the exact opposite of how democracies are supposed to work.

"Except there were other candidates to be the prince who was promised. None of them were Arya. Arya was not a Mary Sue for all the obvious reasons. She absolutely had the capabilities developed over 8 seasons to kill the Night King. But she is also not the prince who was promised, by having Arya kill NK they completely abandoned the prince who was promised thread entirely. And it was pretty fitting to have Melisandre, after 7 seasons of trying to find the prince who was promised, just fall over dead after that story line died. Like that was her whole point in life, being wrong about who the prince who was promised was. But there should still be a prince who was promised.

Jon doesn't have to be he prince who was promised, even the red priests in the show declared Dany the prince who was promised. There are stories of Targarean infighting where one jumps off their dragon to stab someone else mid air on a dragon. Give Dany a dagger or sword and have her do that. Some speculated that Jaime or maybe Tyrion or even Cersei could be the prince who was promised because the books imply the Mad King could have fathered some of Tywins supposed children which would give them the correct bloodline. 

But even if we ignore the prophesy not included in the show, Mel talks about the prince who was promised drawing a flaming sword out of a fire that they use to end the Long Night. Arya didn't do that. She wasn't born amidst salt and smoke or wake dragons out of stone. It was pretty easy to assign these to Dany or Jon. And you could force those onto whoever you want to be the prince who was promised if you are the writers. But they didn't even try with Arya. Unless I missed the foreshadowing that Arya was the prince who was promised, the writers decided to abandon the whole prince who was promised thing. D&amp;D said they decided on Arya 3 years ago, but whoever they chose thats atleast the 7th season plus the first 2 episodes of this season to put even a hint of matching the prophecy. 

Or you could even have Arya do her move but not kill NK. Have a tower of joy type fight where Jon is losing badly, he loses his sword and the NK is about to deal the final blow when Arya flies in and stabs the NK, but he doesnt die because its not lightbringer. Jon picks up longclaw from the fire where it had fallen and, whats this, its on fire now, its Lightbringer. Jon deals the final blow to the wounded NK and the long night is over.",0

He's probably very open to returning as Deadshot in the future so there's no point in recasting him since this just a scheduling thing. I never said anything about him wanting to come back for SS2.,0

"Fascinating and well thought out post but a lot of things still have huge gaps for me.

I) Yes it is very likely NK was one of the First Men but if he sought justice against those who wronged him why did he cause such widespread destruction of his own people during The Long Night? His sense of justice didn't appear to be focused but more the destruction of anything in his path.

II) If he had to be the one to deal the deathblow to the 3ER for sake of ""the old way"" that doesn't make sense based on his previous actions. The person who wronged him (Leaf) was being stabbed by multiple wights causing her to self-destruct. He didn't seem concerned with the old way for her.

III) I can understand his desire for justice against the COTF and their magic but that doesn't correlate well to a human greenseer/warg over 8 thousand years later. It was stated every 1/1000 individuals were born with ability to warg and only 1/1000 of those were born to additionally have the power to be a greenseer. So even if he killed Bran there was never any hint that no more greenseers would ever exist.

IV) He really didn't have to do anything for vengeance simply because the CotF we're dying out already for a very long time. Why did he have to wait 8 thousand years?

The general public is their target market, that means they have to make their shows as accessible as possible.

I am not mad with the show in how the NK got defeated, I am mad with the bad strategics, they simply didn't intended to spend money with the Dothrakis, so they wiped them.

"I mean, in the end, you're doing stuff that gives you a competitive advantage without using third party tools. Using autoexecs increases your fps which makes the game more smooth and inputs more responsive thus giving you an advantage over someone with lower fps, especially if you have a high refresh monitor. If the devs cared about the fairness of competition advantages, they'd lock the game at 60fps/60hz and do shit to peoples' mice so that they'd all feel equal, yet they don't. Hell, people on this subreddit think using +fps_max 300 is cheating even though it was a feature specially added by the devs.

Honestly, this is no different than someone playing poker with reflective sunglasses. You don't see people getting banned for abusing the fact that the idiot on the other side of table has reflective sunglasses allowing literally everyone else at the table to see his hand.

"You guys are both busy. That's completely understandable. And there's nothing wrong with wanting him to communicate with you more when you're separated. Personally, I think going more than 24 hours without talking to your s/o is shitty. Even a 5 minute conversation would suffice. However, being that he's new to relationships as well, and you're both young adults, I genuinely think\* it's not suspicious...more like careless.

So, I would highly recommend having yet another conversation with him about how you'd like some more attention, so to speak, when you're separated. Explain that you miss him. Maybe even designate a specific time where you'll meet up via text, phone or video every night for a 5-10 minute call (or longer).",0

"&gt;Even if streaming services stopped the exclusivity bullshit, torrenting would still be superior because you get the media DRM-free.

DVD and Blu-ray exist. After you buy them, it's free for you to whatever you want with them

&gt;Even if streaming services were superior in terms of convenience, they'd never give the user the same level of control. &lt;

Doesn't have to be, they can just let you stream to another app or program that give you that level of control instead of forcing people to use the default one

From a fundamental view of sports and sportsmanship in general, they make perfect sense - you expect, and are expected to uphold, a level of fairness, all while trying to gain the upper hand on your opponent through legitimate means. In my view however, things become considerably more murky when you apply these principles to sporting *as a career*.

As a career, there’s more on the line; her livelihood and her legacy are now up in the air. To her, it may appear to be a personal condemnation of her skills, the work she put in, and the goals she’s accomplished. All of this on top of the fact that other competitors in various different sports also have genetic predisposition that make them excel - such as Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, etc.

Historically, we’ve celebrated these predispositions and the people who’ve capitalized off them to become the best in their field. To me personally, it doesn’t seem right to bar someone from something they love, have put tremendous time into, and have achieved incredible goals in, based on the notion that something out of their control gives them an upper edge on the competition. Not to detract from the original discussion, but at what point does a genetic predisposition become banned? Should other competitors in different sports be barred or quit because they are “genetically talented”?",0

For starters one would assume there would need to be a crime that would start an investigation. This was not the case here. 
It was suspicion that a crime was committed. None were. This is actually a big considering it is opposite world of our traditional ""Innocent until proven guilty"". 

Second, the tone and meaning completely changes when the person ""obstructing"" knows full well they are innocent and being attacked politically.  If the accused has no recourse to defend themselves against false accusations, then we have done a dis-service to Justice and our political system.

I do not necessarily disagree with the statute. I do however disagree with this constant battering of the edges our justice system to punish political opponents and all of their associates. This is wrong and counter to the spirit of justice. These splitting of hairs does not rise to the level of rational justice.

I got a job, doing labour, it's not glamorous, but I make enough. I stopped caring about the idea of a ideal life path. I'm also very lucky, I have a kind and supportive family, an incredibly strong and diverse friend group who aren't afraid to really back each other up, and I live in Canada, so there is a semi functioning social welfare system.

I used the time that I dont spend in the office (50+ hour weeks with no paid overtime as opposed to 35 a week no excpetions) to volunteer at my local spots, I helped start an urban farm that donates all of its food, I worked at a food bank, I attend a lot of protests, building parallel power just became my hobby.

We all have to make sacrifices under capitalism to live, so it's not like we can just completely quit working. I'm still tired after work, and I still don't LOVE what I do, but I get to turn it off after work and I get to work with real working class people rather than a bunch of soulless bootlickers who think they are the most innovative people in the world.

"I'm not a SJW, far from it... and I absolutely hated what is happening to movies.... and heck, comedy... its ""PG"" rated these days and its all about empowerment etc... the media makes me sick...

With that said.... Arya is no Mary Sue, I re-watched from Season 1 and Arya was clearly influenced by her father Ned. She's also skilled and most likely more skilled than her brothers except maybe Jon, who would be better in some aspects of swordsman ship etc.

Back in the olden days, Arya would just be what ""Ripley"" was in Aliens, she would just be Joan of Arc, she's that typical bad-ass female with interest in typically men-things, like fighting and weapons etc. 

But today, its understandable why  some would view her differently, because society and the media have shoved it down our throats.

I think most Game of Thrones aficionados can see that Arya is actually very qualified to be able to kill anyone in the Westeros or even Essos, as she's a friggin Assassin and have been trained by one of the infamous Assassin in the Game of Thrones planet.


The issue is not Arya, but the Night's King.... so powerful, Hard Home episode was the perfect example of how powerful and threatening this character is.

I stick to my belief that fate was planned all along by the Lord of Light, Faceless Deity and 3-Eyed Raven to set up the Night's King to be defenseless under that tree next to Bran... and Arya being an assassin and a Valyrian dagger in their possession which happened to be used to try to kill Bran...  so  it was meant to get to Winterfell and be in possession of a Stark eventually.

But The Night's King basically got short strawed by the writers... someone in the creative room should have voiced that this is not the best way to end a built up character.

Its like Thanos being killed by Hawkeye just before he even got to explain why he was collecting the stones... 

Thanos has become one of the most iconic villains since Darth Vader because the writers respected him.

I think the Night's King was respected to an extent, before being sold short....  its like they ran out of episodes to showcase him and show a more proper way to eliminate him so they ""Return of the King'd"" him, as in similar to the Ghost Army arriving and just sweeping the entire Orc army within seconds in the last second of a great battle...

for kids.. this kind of ending may work... and probably suitable as it wont bother them

Lots of people heard the Sermon on the Mount, and that includes the so-called Lord's Prayer, which is likely repeated pretty much verbatim.

One thing he said in Aramaic while being crucified is explicitly repeated verbatim, in Aramaic, being quoted as 'eli eli lama sabachtani', which is apparently not standard Hebrew but the kind of Aramaic that Jesus would have spoken.

It's also quite possible to recognize what kinds of things that Jesus says and how he says them. It's like, if you hear a song, one by Bach and one by Mozart you can say 'that's clearly Mozart' and 'that's clearly Bach'. It's the same way with what Jesus says. He has certain views and often expresses them in certain characteristic ways. He liked to use parables and certain paradoxical juxtapositions, for example.",0

"One of the reasons cable TV has such a bloated price is that in order to negotiate for ""all"" the channels the cable TV provider has to spend a large about of money. This forces them to raise their prices to make a profit.

Most streaming services also have to negotiate for rights to stream a specific show, and they keep their prices lowon the other hand by having a select amount of content, that caters to specific viewing audience. Netflix constantly, removed shows from their because it isn't worth the cost to have that show

It would be impractical to think that a streaming service that has ""everything"" will not have an equally bloated price tag. Remember that everything wouldn't be just anime, but sports, reality, dramas, romance, action, international, etc..

My point is that is the inconvenience a big enough problem to make it worth while to have a service with ""everything"" and a larger price tag, or to pick specific services that cater to what you want and cost less?


As for your second point, how does piracy help make more of the content you want to see? 

Put yourself in the studios shoes; what content are you going to choose to make? You're likely to pick something popular, like shonen or isekai, or maybe something with a more niche appeal. But regardless it will be something you believe people will want to watch, which will make you money and keep the studio running.  

But then how will you judge the shows success? Social media traffic? A likely choice is how many people watched the show, and you will measure this by contacting the services you partnered with to see is performance. You're not going to look a pirate sites since they don't make you money.

Or to give you a traditional answer I could go back to age old answer that a portion of the money from the legal streaming sites goes back to the original creators; while none of the pirate sites give money back to the original creators.

Either way pirate sites don't help the industry to grow, only limit it.",0

This is a question which has been bugging me to no end. I've talked to my parents and friends about it, and they're split about 50/50, so I'm submitting this to you, Reddit: am I the asshole?

Every single year, my friends and I go to a carnival. It's a kind of town fundraiser thing where they bring in all these different booths, and you can buy tickets and play these different games and try to win something cool, etc. My best friend, let's call him John, has a tradition of always playing this one skee-ball game where you have five balls and try to get them into these concentric rings. Not only does he like playing this game, he also wants all of the rest of our friends to always spend all of our tickets playing this game. He justifies this by saying that it's the only game in the entire park where you can win a stuffed lion, which is the biggest reward in the whole amusement part.

Here's where it gets interesting: his girlfriend has always had a bit of a thing for me, and this year she got bored playing skee-ball in like the first fifteen minutes (we are usually there for about an hour). John was busy playing skee-ball and all of our friends were watching, but she pulled me aside to go play this other, newer game called Bam-Ski. Bam-Ski is actually not that much fun at all if I am to be honest--you basically try to hit this ball with your fist into a bunch of different jugs, and if you get three into a jug with a rim of a certain color, you can win stuff. I wasn't having that much fun, but she really wanted to play this game, and so I played with her for about half an hour. Another thing about Bam-Ski is that unlike the other games in the park, it has the WORST rewards, like if you get three balls into the jug, you basically get like a small pack of Oreos or something, compared to the huge tigers you could get at skee-ball. Basically, at the very end, all my friends came over (including John) and saw me toss three balls into the jug. I ended up winning the Oreos, and sharing one of them with John's girlfriend. Suddenly John knocked the Oreos out of my hand and threatened to fight me. I asked him why he was getting so mad and he said that I chose to worst game in the entire park and wasted my time and even though I won, I ended up with just a pack of Oreos to show for it. He dangled his huge stuffed lion in my face just to mock me. His girlfriend intervened to try to stop him but John kept advancing on me. Honestly I had enough so I left--even though Bam-Ski wasn't objectively as good of a game as the others, and even though I only won a pack of Oreos, I had a good time. 

AITA for playing a shitty game and winning shitty prizes?

No, it's not interesting and has nothing to do with the story. If the story is specifically about gays, that's fine. I have no interest in watching it. As long as I know beforehand.

My ghost was forced to stay on Earth and linger on that stretch of highway. Got some bikers to follow me to my body. Made a whole scene of the police finally finding me and I could finally rest in peace.

Im one of them. at my old job I used to listen to the boss and his brother wax poetic about how everyone who owned a gun should be thrown in jail and had a tiny penis and were just itching to murder anyone who disagreed with them and how if he ever found out someone was carrying at work they would be fired and he would deny service to anyone who he knew had a gun. all the while I was concealing a large frame handgun on my person for years right under their upturned noses.,0

I consider myself middle class, but realistically by the numbers I'm probably on the lower end of upper class.  The wife and I both earn 6 figures each in a fairly cheap cost of living area.  We invest and/or save about half our income in the hopes of retiring (at least from a 9-5 job) in the next few years.  Most of that investment is in property we rent out to build a passive income.

So most people that really know me would probably describe me as upper class.  But if you looked at me and didn't know me, you'd think I was at best middle class and possibly poor.

"First off, if Trump wanted Mueller fired, he could have fired him.  So it would be hard to prove there was an attempt because there was nothing to stop trump from firing Mueller.

Beyond that, it would have to be proven that replacing Mueller would actually obstruct the investigation.  An excellent argument can be made using Mueller's decades-long reputation as a hack and a proven liar, from the whitey bulger fiasco, to presenting fake evidence to Congress before Iraq, to the current investigation where he hired people so biased that they had to be removed from the investigation.  An excellent argument could be made that the investigation would be handled better by someone other than Comey's friend Mueller, someone who was comfortable presenting fake evidence in the past.

Good luck proving that asking a subordinate about firing Mueller even happened, much less than proving it was a crime to discuss it.",0

"&gt; They just play primitive football.

If you had actually watched us at our peak you know that is blatantly not true. Our current poor play is almost completely due to personnel problems and other external factors.

&gt;  So not signing players still doesn't remove the fact that they have a superior squad. Both in depth and quality.

That is again, not true. Vertonghen and Alderweireld are definitely better than Blind and De Ligt, and Son and Kane are definitely better than what Ajax have. Then Eriksen is still a bit better than Ziyech and Alli is better than Van de Beek, but after that it quickly stops. You could argue Lloris is better than Onana, but with the amount of mistakes he's made recently and taking his passing quality into account I'd actually say it's pretty even between them.

And then you have to consider that Kane and Son were out and that Eriksen and Alli play deeper than they normally do and are dead tired, and suddenly it's pretty much even how good the squads are. If not Ajax being slightly better. Tottenham have absolutely no depth at the moment with all the injuries. And I say that as someone who has followed both teams on foot for almost 10 years now.",0

"U should rly search abt what it rly means to be transsexual. The brain activity of a transsexual women is similar to the brain activity of a man.

So saying that  &gt;She is biologically a male if she has a dick. is just 
scientifically wrong. 

Also... &gt;She is able to transition to Female if she wants. With this ure saying that if she wants to be accepted in society and have the normal life and rights of a normal teenage girl she has to surgically change how she is, how she was born, something that she had no control or choice at all.

"I just did it without the soul vaults and with the other 2 amulets in. I just used the lever right in front of the Shinnok slot. Stand in between the lever and the empty slot, and find the place where you can get the icon to change from the lock to X to pull the lever just by moving the camera around. Then it's a matter of timing the camera move from the lever to the slot at the same time you press X.

It probably took me around 10 minutes and several tries, but it's possible.",0

There's the bad faith argument. Self defense is the natural right of all living things, and 2A recognizes that. It's not about what we want, it's about our fundamental right. There certainly is room for debate inside that, but certainly evolution points to having the best self defense mechanisms possible.",0

"There hasn’t been a single fix to that episode I’ve read that wasn’t better than the episode.  It’s also the reason why so many people find it hard she killed the NK because she was turned into a cartoon.

Without that episode, this would be Arya : 

Her character has been about death every since she met Syrio.  She follows the many faced God, who’s name is death. She is also pretty fast and nimble. She also fought best blind which makes the dark and very hard to see situation to her advantage. She also was without needle during most of her journey, making most of her training with a staff with the Faceless men. So the weapon Gendry made her is very fitting to that.  So I would expect her to be able to contribute a many number of kills, and she did to her credit. Including the NK.  Especially the blind training part.  I could even believe ( if indeed the aim was for the heart) going for the heart area because of the Hound teaching her where the heart is.  Yes as an assassin she was pretty sloppy.  But we did at least see blind training. 

Except she’s a cartoon now and not enough distance between that and Sundays episode has happened to grow her character beyond that.  She shouldn’t be that good fighting Brienne because of staff training and Needle not because being able to be used.  She had no experience running a castle and somehow did so for 2 weeks as Walder Frey.  She let all the women know it was her in Frey castle and yet no one came for her.  She decided to kill her sister because she likes pretty things. A plot that got resolved in a stupid neat bow.  She is now associated with over hyped ridiculousness.  And it all comes back to that episode and what followed.",0

"Can you really not figure this shit out? Cops get to kill people with impunity in the US. One of the only cops that gets charged and convicted is a Somali immigrant after killing a white Australian woman. 

Absolutely none of the bluelivesmatter people defend the guy...for some reason. Instead they populate this thread with shit like 'fast-tracked diversity hire' because I guess black people are too dumb to be cops. 

For those of us that want cops to be held accountable, this conviction doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot. It only means that non-white cops are held to a different standard(something close to how we'd like to see all cops held to), which is something we already knew.",0

"Written in the page of the book that Sam sees a picture of the dagger that Arya has in the show it says that dragon glass is brittle and therefore it was used as hilts and pummels in blades. As valyrian steel is the best cut a blade can have is it not the opposite of dragon glass? And also the opposite of what it was used to create the nk?

"The power of Jon Favreau talking to Tony's daughter, reminiscing about his buddy was so fucking beautiful, I teared up.

"If they extend the war any longer their economy crumbles before they can get nuked. Any plan that involves them staying in the fight longer is a losing one.

Team subs are almost like Facebook sports groups sometimes.,0
"&gt;1) You erase the experiences of everyone who doesn't fit that demographic. 

Care to expand on that thought?  You liking them despite probably not being in their target demo doesn't erase anything you experience.  You just happen to like something that wasn't initially targeted to you.  BTS is a boy band.  Boy bands are targeted to attract tween girls because they can get their parents to buy shit like merch and tickets.  And then the parents become fans because that's what parents do.  

&gt;2) it shames people into not trying to look into the music themselves because they think it would be embarrassing. 

I literally have never stopped and thought to myself ""shit, I'm listening to Britney Spears...what would my friends think?""  If you have such poor self-confidence that you would actively disregard entertainment that *you like* because of what someone else thinks, you probably are so susceptible to peer pressure that when BTS become tired and washed, your fandom will die.  


&gt;3) It implies that the interests of female teenagers are always shallow or unworthy of a larger audience.

Always?  No.  But it's not really crazy to say that teenagers - male or female - generally are shallow people with short attention spans who pivot towards what is popular in media.  That's why social media apps limit video lengths.  That's why smash cuts exist on almost every YT channel that targets teenagers.  That's why what's popular in fashion for teenagers changes all the time (remember trucker hats?)  That's why new slang is always being used and then cancelled.  Why do you think all pop songs are sub 4 minutes long?  Attention span.

You can act like these things are shocking or new, but it's not.",0

However, this was also when most of the bugs in the game started becoming even more apparent since the update broke a lot of things. What should be happening, because the subreddit is growing extremely quick, is the number of comments and posts should be increasing, not severely decreasing as the charts show. This means less people are active on this subreddit even though it should be growing. Why? Because of all the issues. Because of the lack of communication. Because of the lack of updates or meaningful content. So even though it is growing (however more slowly now) people don't care as much about the game.

"&gt; But sure, they got TVs and refrigerators in most houses now, that's what matters, right?

Chile is the richest country in SA and has a better quality of life than almost every other SA country. That’s a bit different then saying they have TVs and refrigerators. Your downplaying of their economy shows how biased you are already. 

Of course Pinochet was a murderous dictator. What does that have to do with the Chilean economy? 

&gt; May I remind you, the reason this happened in Chile was that Allende spent heavily on social programs, greatly improving the standard of living of poor Chileans. Neoliberalism doesn't like social programs, because that's tax money that corporations that come to exploit labor, resources and economic opportunity won't be able to steal.

No. The reason that happened is because Allende ruined the economy with his socialist policies, very similarly to how Chávez/Maduro ruined theirs. Both the Chilean and Venezuelan economy had short term gains from the nationalization and appropriation of property and resources (which, btw, was against Chile’s constitution). Then economic reality set in, and their economies completely crashed. 

&gt; Jesus fucking Christ, do you really think the entire Global South is poor because they don't work hard enough? The Global South is poor because of plundering by developed nations (all developed nations) through the establishment of neoliberalism.

No, the global south is poor because they typically have one or possibly a few major resources they build their economy around through exports. Liberalizing markets has proven to be one of the most effective ways of growing an economy and raising the standard of living. Look what the economic reforms have done to India, China, and *wink wink* Chile.",0

This person does not have a right to tell her friend what to do.  This is between the people in the relationship.  If it bothered the boyfriend, he could bring it up with his girlfriend.  I have close male friends that I love and go out with without my husband.  While I don't have 'feelings' for them, you are allowed to have friends you like to talk to and hang out with.

I know I will get downvoted but sometimes people have an extremely unhealthy view of how friendships should work when you are in a relationship.  She should be allowed to go to the movies and a concert without her FRIEND getting mad at her.  Jesus.

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

When I was a kid (around 11), I confessed to my parents that I had started watching porn and masturbating. I felt guilty since I had a very religious upbringing and needed to get it off my chest. I wanted to do the right thing. Their response was to take the locks off my bedroom and bathroom doors, and replace my shower curtains with clear see-through plastic. On a regular basis, they would whip open the bathroom door trying to catch me jerking off on the toilet or in the shower. And if they caught me, they would make me stop in the middle and we’d have a long talk. They’d angrily ask what the fuck is wrong with me and make me feel like I’m some sort of degenerate. They didn’t even allow me to date in high school because they thought nothing but trouble would come from me getting romantic with a girl that young. Fast forward to college. I learn that exploring your sexuality as an adolescent is normal and nothing to be ashamed of. I also realize that my parents have set me up for failure in relationships by not allowing me to gain dating experience at a younger age. I leave the church for that among other reasons. I tell my parents about my decision. When they come to my college graduation, my mom can’t even look at me because she’s disgusted and ashamed of my decision (as if it were directed as a slight to her personally) and my dad says that he almost threw himself off the balcony in our chapel and killed himself because he was so embarrassed by me. But honestly, I don’t give a rat’s ass how they feel. I don’t owe them a goddamn thing, and as much as I’d like to forgive them, I fucking hate them. I’m scarred for life from the shit they pulled when I was too young to look out for myself. I can’t even afford therapy because I’m doing contract-to-hire work and don’t have good health insurance yet. Both parents have apologized and I said I’d forgive them but I know I really can’t. I can tell they’re doing the same shit to my little brothers so they must not really be sorry. They don’t want to lose me forever so they’re saying what they have to say. But I think they’ve already lost me. AITA for avoiding them whenever possible and should I be trying to repair this relationship for the sake of family? I don’t want to make a horrible mistake I’ll regret forever.

TL;DR I hate my parents for repressing my sexuality as a kid and actively avoid them now, but I’m worried that I’m making a mistake.

"When I was a young teen (pre smart phone), my mom joined a prayer group at one of the churches we used to go to. Every Saturday, she'd be gone for hours with no contact, which isn't normal when you have kids at home who depend on you. I  found out why when I got dropped off at the church to meet my mom as a meeting was wrapping up. 

There was a landline outside the meeting room - the same one I would call - ringing non-stop that no one answered because they were *intensely* focused on the pastor. He had them holding an American flag and walking in a circle praying for God to rule the country. There was a globe too, that they used to ""pray for the nation.""

Once that hoodoo wrapped up, the pastor started randomly pulling people one by one into his office to give them a Word (a special message from God). A woman my mom was speaking to was impatiently waiting for her friend to come out. I suggested knocking on the door and she looked at me like I had three heads. You DID NOT interrupt God's vessel. Ever.

You have not driven in or around the ghetto, have you? I went to school with kids that had mothers as welfare queens. Girls that followed in their mothers and grandmothers footsteps. 

I’m not from Europe but I hear gypsies do that very thing. 

Where I live I know and know of several family’s that manipulate the system to the best of their ability. Not all of which are poor. One that stands out are actually wealthy but they manipulate the system by not legally marrying. They collect EBT and have government healthcare. They live in a fucking mansion and the wives go on lavish vacations. (Lavish from a middle class perspective) 

 Others aren’t wealthy but middle class and see it as getting help but it’s abuse in my opinion. 
 Depending on the family circumstances they can get EBT ranging from 400 to 1000 a month in EBT l 

You can also consider they didn’t have kids because they can collect more. They just wanted more kids and the government gave them a way to have more kids. There are a ton of ppl that want large families but realize it’s not feasible based on their income.  I wanted a huge family until I had 1. Now I think I’m good.

 In my state certain groups don’t legally get married to collect from the government. They have 5-10 kid due to their culture/religion and pretend they are single mothers.",0

"If this is an honest question, I'll give an honest response.

Its not about being able to suspend one's disbelief about the universe being magical, its about being able to suspend disbelief within the consistency of the story itself within the universe.

1) Arya's training was in part learning how to fight in hand to hand combat.... but also, and specifically, by observing her opponent.  Hiding in plain sight and then exploiting weaknesses and opportunities.  This wasn't just in how she murdered people, but also in how she fought in combat (eg. the Waif).  Her training was never about being a stealthy ninja who sneaked around silently. 

2) she was only temporarily successful at sneaking around in the library and eventually got caught... and with only a handful of undead, as opposed to the tight ring of many more in the courtyard. On top of that, those in the library seemed capable of hearing something as quiet as a 'drop of blood' 

3) the actual event itself (Arya sneaking around the undead) was never actually shown on screen.  The only hint we get is one of the wight's hair move... then we see her in mid air.  It doesn't 'feel' like she was sneaking... and rather that she jumped.  But even if she was 'sneaking'... then how fast was she sneaking around to make the undead's hair move?  She can now just as (more) successfully sneak while running as she does when she's carefully finding spots to hide?  (and if so, this raises the question, why didn't she just do that in the library then?)

The whole series of events feels dishonest and contrived to me.  Which is why it broke my suspension of disbelief",0

"One thing is clear America, you need some serious revisions of your laws regarding your presidents. You should probably work on that as soon as this train wreck comes to its fiery/explosive end...

Tax returns should be mandatory for every elected leader, including the president, and should probably be a minimum of 10 years, if not even more... 

Cut all business ties by letting someone unrelated handle the presidents business until his term is finished (if this is unacceptable, then don't run for office) 

Anti nepotism laws should be stricter, no family ties unless they are qualified for the position and even then it should be reviewed by a qualified board of experts... Close loopholes like Jarred and Ivanka currently are using...",0

In 1977 Noll had a player charged with cocaine possession, had to defend himself against a defamation lawsuit instead of being at training camp, had multiple players complain about their salaries and was sued by one of his own players. He also once had a player shoot at a police helicopter that was chasing him. 


Cowher’s  teams had issues as well.   He had players busted for drugs and substance abuse issues.  Before the 1994 AFC Championship game some Steelers players made a Super Bowl rap video then they lost in the AFC championship game.  In 2000 he had two players involved in a stool swinging fight in training camp. Burris and Porter also has multiple issues while Cowher was the coach. 

Tomlin is getting shot because he is the coach now.

That's why we have strict licencing and tests before you can drive. You can be disqualified from driving for both failing test and for many medical conditions. You have to register any vehicle you own and in many states also have it regularly inspected. Cops are on patrol anywhere a car is used. Any infraction such as drinking while driving gets your license taken away. Cities and states control where and when cars or trucks can go certain places. Larger vehicles require a special licence to operate and you have to keep a log book depending on what you are doing as well as stopping at government run weight stations to inspect your large truck at stops through out the states.

"Why is everyone making assumptions about the roommate?  No, he shouldn’t be taking OP’s bath wash.  But HIS condoms and HIS sex life are his own business!  Period.  

If you don’t trust your fiancé and your best friend, then you shouldn’t be with either. 

Your best friend does not owe you explanations about HIS sex life. 

If you supposedly think your girlfriend can’t lie, then why are you still looking into this?  You asked her, she said no, shouldn’t that be the end of the convo? 

I mean he had no right to take your stuff.  But you’re also being intrusive of his privacy/condoms/sex life.  It’s not your business unless he tells you. 

You can’t say your girlfriend doesn’t lie...then in the next breathe be questioning if she’s cheating.  It’s contradictory.  You either believe her or you don’t.  

Also, every SINGLE person lies!  Not always for malicious and deceitful intent.  But every one lies and is capable of lying.  Don’t be so naive it can get you in trouble...possibly in this situation too. 

But I think you made a far leap from finding your best friends condoms to he’s sleeping with my fiancé.  I mean have you noticed the acting differently?",0

As for the women, it really depends on how the card is ran, if the Mitb goes first, or early, Bliss is winning and taking the winner of the 2nd womans match of the night. Which would be great if Lacy won and Alexa stole it. Then Lynch can stay on SD and focus on that show.

"&gt;This bug is not a critical aspect of the game.

It IS a one of the challenges for the End Game Challenges and one of, if not the hardest. With this bug, it becomes almost impossible. Yes it's unfortunate the bug was not found before the ltm was released, but its also extremely frustrating trying to do the challenge, only to be set back by other players either griefing or also trying to do the challenge. A challenge that is hard enough with only a 50% of being able to do it, with it only being available when your on the chitauri side, and then having only 6 chances, with your competition being every other player on the field.   


Outside picking up the first dropped stone (which in itself is still a challenge), picking up a stone is an extremely rare task that only seems to frustrate players as they try to complete the challenge with limited time while trying to complete a challenge that has become harder than it already is.   


I feel for the poor devs, but they should figure out a compromise for those trying to complete the challenge. Right now it's gotten to the point the Avengers team is less likely to stop you getting a stone then your teammates.",0
"&gt; Oh that thing all Americans are entitled to by law? That thing you would only not have if you chose not to attend?

just because you are entitled to an *education* does not mean that that education will be properly funded or quality education, or serve your needs in any way. it's almost like property taxes being used to fund public education is a way of making sure low income communities have a lower chance of receiving the quality education necessary to break out of that low income community.

&gt; Too bad. Should've gone to fucking school.

[did you know that juvenile crime, dropout rates and delinquency are tied to income level?](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/inequality/the-link-between-automatic-responses-in-low-income-children-and-crime-dropout-rates-in-chicago/)

&gt; Incorrect. Everyone has access to the internet and a computer. This is a bullshit, lazy excuse. Go to a library. You can get on for free.

i obviously meant personal access. not every library is well funded or has the same opportunities it can give to the people who use it. and even if you do have the access that doesn't guarantee that you know *what* to do with that access. my 50 year old mother still has issues with technology and needs me to figure out basic shit on her remote that could be solved with a second of googling, and yet she doesn't google it because she feels she lacks the prerequisite knowledge to even *start googling* shit like that. why do you think this trend doesn't apply to low income communities who don't have regular access to personal computers?

&gt; Takes less than an hour to find out what a mortgage is and how it works. ""Not having time"" is bullshit. Everyone has time to do that. Nobody works for 20 hours a day every day. If they do, it is by choice and they should have plenty of money.

plenty of people work several jobs and still find themselves living paycheck to paycheck. jobs don't guarantee a livable wage, not even multiple jobs. maybe when you're only supporting yourself and yourself alone, but that is not always the case. especially because, guess what, birth rates are tied to education and income level (and the ties to education can be explained by the effect income level of the community surrounding the school has on the quality of education and opportunities being given, soo...)",0

"Tbh I didn’t get that impression from Widow. Clint was definitely trying to throw his life away; throughout the movie it’s pretty clear that he doesn’t care if he lives or dies. I personally feel like Natasha would have preferred to live.

As for Tony, I’m not arguing that it should have been someone else. I’m just saying that the fingersnap was the objective, whereas Natasha’s objective was “die so that Clint gets the stone.” Sure Tony knew that the fingersnap would kill him, but if he had been miraculously healed after the snap, the snap still stands. There was some hypothetical situation in which he could have lived (not that he should have lived, his sacrifice was very important too). 

For the Soul Stone sacrifice, there was no possible scenario in which both Natasha and Clint would live.

Maybe telling them not to send Nebula to Morag in 2014.

"I think ""structurally"", the episode was great: cinematography, pacing, scoring, etc. 

My favorite part was Arya. I'm tired of detailing how her kill of TNK actually makes sense *within the context of the episode*, (and I should be working rn lol), so I'll just say if you consider everything that happens to her in the episode as a whole instead of each scene individually, it makes a lot more sense.

The episode got me to feel something for the show again, and that's something that hasn't happened in a long time. The atmosphere of dread they built was fantastic, and Arya tricking TNK and getting the final kill was very climactic for me, especially how it happened so quickly. It was one of the few times I actually yelled ""HOOOOooooooly SHIT!"" at the screen. The last time I felt something as strongly for the show was from Jaime charging Dany on the lakeside. My heart filled with anxiety and joy as it cheered Jaime on, and it took all of my self control to hold it in and not shout and cheer and wake up my wife and newborn child.

Of course in retrospect, I am disappointed TNK is gone in one episode. I'm hopeful we haven't seen the last of him (my favorite theory is that he lives on in bran a la horcrux, and will be reborn through bran in the next couple episodes), but I learned long ago (especially after the Waif) that pretty much what we see is what we get. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't like the way it was executed.",0

TBH, he should not be able to start working at a new company without quitting his previous job, since there are issues with the social security payments if he is collecting a full-time salary from more than one company.

"1. Thank you for raising my attention, I won't fly Lion Air.
2. You unintentionally mixed Eth into the same category. This is unfair and misleading. Will you fix that?
3. Make conclusion based on 2 metrics? I prefer to make conclusions after days of research. 

These metrics are good to make a conclusion what airline to fly, but this thread is about the causes of an accident. Sounds like you want to suggest to make a final conclusion on the accidents based on the safety record of Lion. Do you? I don't think so. That's just one aspect. 

All the research I'm past revealed so many flaws and weaknesses in the Max design, that at the moment I believe it's just a matter of time for one to surface, and bring down the next Max of ANY airline.

We have to focus on the safety of future flights at all airlines, not the blame game.

It's interesting that you bring up cars, because if you look at the history of car safety regulation, it was actually pressure from the constant news stories that caused political action and gave us the much safer cars we drive today.

"Those cases tend to be due to cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM or HOCM) - they don’t cause a myocardial infarction (heart attack), but instead a cardiac arrest, where your heart stops beating. In cardiomyopathies this is generally due to an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). A myocardial infarction is where one of the blood vessels that supplies your heart muscle gets blocked by a clot, and so part of the heart muscle tissue is starved of oxygen. 

Slightly different pathologies - but of course both very serious. HCM is the biggest cause of sudden cardiac death in younger men, and in athletes. It doesn’t appear to be what happened with Casillas.",0

That just makes me feel fucking rejected just like my ex. (Take me back, Roxanne.) f. What're you, fuckin' gay?

So Turkey is showing its power of Saudi with the evidence of the killing of that Americian journalist resident.  The mention here is now tit for tat back about the Coups in both countries.,0

"LOTR was thought to be impossible to port into a movie that shows the same awesomeness as the book. But when Jackson started filming it looked like this time he might be able to deliver a great movie. Keeping the size of the book in mind, announcing a trilogy  made sense. Being a fan himself, he worked with other fans. He was lucky to work with one exceptional actor (many in fact) which was not also a fan, but met J.R.R. Tolkien in Person. Christopher Reeve, playing Saruman.  
I still think the books are superior but Jackson gave them „a run for their money“. I don‘t see how anyone could create a better movie of the books ever.",0

The word ""matchmaking"" by itself does not imply it takes some measurment into account so its not really a wild and naive exaggeration...

"I've never lived in the US, or specifically a state where weed is legal, so alcohol is the closest I've ever regularly been to that feeling of contentment and detachment.

I'm literally drinking alone in a pub (UK) as I'm typing this, and I love it. I love audiobook, I love pubs, the whole shabang.

After about for pints in, you feel that slight ""weight"" on your brain, almost as if it's forcing you to relax. The detachment kicks in, and you look at people, filled with wonder as to who they are and what they're doing (this is the inhibition bit), and just have this real relaxed feeling.

When I was 15, and in school, our chemistry teacher asked us ""who here likes beer?"" Most of the boys and a couple of girls raised their hands. He retorded with something along the lines of ""you're all liars, beer is literally too bitter for the palate of a 15 year old"".

Long story short, maybe alcohol isn't for you OP, maybe you're just not ready for it, maybe weed is better (I don't have the legal privilege of knowing), maybe you're friends / social situation sucks.

Yea, in several different towns. What did you want? The only way to have thousands of people is with external forces on the field. Venezuela isn't that big. 

&gt; Whataboutism is just a bullshit way of trying to deflect someone pointing out your hypocrisy, but I'm not sure that disproving your claim with counterexamples (state security murdering peaceful protesters in cold blood, and nothing happening) even qualifies as whataboutism.

""What happened in X is wrong and something should be done about it"" -&gt; ""Well, same thing happened in Y"". Whataboutism.

&gt; tensions are bound to be running high

Well that explains it then. Idk why you are against cops killing people. At some point, someone fired against them. Tensions are bound to be running high. Who cares if the people killed are not the shooters anyway?

&gt; America being a dystopian shithole which drives people to violent crime doesn't excuse it's authoritarian police force and their murder of civilians.

Ok so first of all, I take issue with the core of that argument, which is that nobody has any personal responsability and is only a product of whatever society and environment they are in. Victim mentality. I realize I'm in the wrong sub to talk about this.

Second of all, the superficial layer of that argument also makes no sense. Even if I take for granted that people are purely a product of their culture and have no say of their own, and that society somehow forced these people to start beating and robbing and killing innocent people, now they can't be opposed? Because opposing them, according to you, is killing a civilian? Whaaa?

No, but saying that cops are killing people who are running stop signs instead of looking at the actual crime stats is.",0

The goal is a Super Bowl, and they weren't close enough to basically forfeit the two ways they can improve the roster, which is through FA, and through the draft.

That's a trade you make if you're Indy or Cleveland; two teams that are already banging on the playoff door prior to him. Your goal at that point is he's the missing piece to push you over the edge.

There's quite frankly several rosters that are simply better than the Bears, both in starters, and drastically in depth. It honestly feels like the Bears are at their ceiling. It's nice if playoff push is the end goal, but I just can't see how this roster wins a Super Bowl.",0

"And both sat in an underground room, hiding from the battle. If that is all she did, she would be just like Gilly. But Sansa is like Slynt not just for hiding, but because she doesn't know any better than to NOT trash talk the people risking their lives and actually leading in the battle. And to make matters worse, she hid in the crypts and listened while her ancestors killed the same people she claimed she wouldn't abandon one hour earlier.

If Sansa says one word of trash about Dany or Jon after they return to the great hall, Missandei needs to pull a Sam and remind folks that Sansa was hiding in a puddle of her own making while Jon, Dany, Arya, and even little Lyanna were fighting outside.",0

"It of course isn’t going to be the case for every woman or every man but it’s making the point that men on average want sex more than women. 

There is actual evidence and studies that show that men have higher sex drives than women on average. In one such study for example, student researchers were sent out on campus to ask students of the opposite sex if they would like to go to bed with them that night. More than three quarters of the men said yes but not a single woman answered yes. Not one. Maybe they just got the women on a bad day I guess. Every single one.

"They were friends before being FWB. They maintain that friendship via weekly phone calls. She developed feelings for him, which I’m assuming she was open and honest about and that’s how you know, he did not reciprocate and has no desire to be with her. She IS going on her trip. She’s never done something to warrant distrust. She invited you to go with her on the trip. 

Those are the facts and those are the only things you should be basing your reaction on. You’re feeling intimidated by her spending time with him. I cannot stress how important being secure with yourself is in a relationship because that will mess things up faster than almost anything else. You can’t try to control her in an effort to make you feel better about yourself. 

If you think that her canceling the trip is going to make things better then you’re dead wrong. It’ll only be better for YOU until the next time you’re feeling insecure about something she does. She’s obviously someone who values maintaining her own identity and making her own choices, that’s not wrong but if you can’t handle that then you need to go, it’ll only cause problems.",0

"Respect isn't lost forever. Dear god you frustrate me with your single track mind. It's people who think like you that help drive the idea that relationships can't be fixed. 

Respect and trust can be rebuilt, reformed and changed. Nothing in life is static. As for her lack of respect, get this through that head _She has respect for him!_. She is not showing it well, but she is sitting there trying to talk things through, despite the stress and anxiety she would be going through (I do not sympathize with her). She is cheating, but WHY? Knowing that gives a clearer idea of what is going on in the relationship. And that is where conversation needs to start, not with a ""Stop this right now"".

I never intended for the idea of polyamory to magically fix what is wrong there, but it was an option, for later use. This level of relationship issues should be getting dealt with in a councilor's office, not reddit, yet here we are. 

For the OP, you need to understand that no matter what happens, to fix the relationship or to end it, there is going to be a lot of work needed, and that for any of the options to work (outside of divorce) you are both going to have to be committed to the path you choose.",0

"every blonde-haired blue-eyed ""woke"" landwhale on twitter talking about 'hurr durr mah US imperialism mah regieeeeeme change' like they have some higher knowledge that isn't blatantly obvious and they're super proud of their perfectly snarky tweet joke  about it that even has a nice lil anti-Nazi jab to boot to really nail it home.

"&gt;Wonder Woman does a better job imho

Are you a dude? Because no offense but I've only ever seen guys say this. Every woman I ask thinks Captain Marvel did a waaay better job. WW comes off like a man wrote it. So much dialogue about her being a woman, that women are about love, scenes where she shrieks with joy because she saw a baby, still features a courageous and important man, etc.

Captain Marvel did none of that garbage. The whole movie came off like it genuinely was made *for* women. It was full of symbolism of issues women face. Plus, no male stole her spotlight unlike WW. CM was allowed to be unapologetically for women. No bs ""WoMeN WiLl SaVe ThE WoRlD wItH lOvE oooo squeel a baby ooo a man I must fall in love oooo""",0

All this giving people excuses to blame their actions on just gets rid of any incentive to do that hard but right thing and say no.  Why try to be a better person when nobody is going to hold you accountable for the path you chose to go down?  It's throughout your post and in the answers the girls gave in the video; other people are to blame and should have acted differently.  That solves nothing and just leads to more of the same.

"Theoden is one of my favourite characters from the book.  His arc is so satisfying to me.  He's not an elf, or a descendent of Numenor.  He's just a man, doing the best he can even though he thinks all is lost.

My fave passage, from RotK is this:

&gt; At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:

&gt;&gt;Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

&gt;&gt;Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

&gt;&gt;spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,
a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

&gt;&gt;Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

&gt;With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

&gt;&gt;Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

&gt;Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. 
After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. 

&gt;Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. 

&gt;Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. 

&gt;His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and the darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. 

&gt;And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.",0

"&gt;I think I misunderstood you about escalating conflict - I thought you were referring to Arya reconciling her more murderous tendencies with herself and her reunited family.

I could have put it into better words but what you mentioned here would actually be part of it.

What I meant was inner conflict, the turmoil that pretty much all the big (beloved in show &amp; books) characters go through. Until now I thought show-Arya was handled better than say Tyrion, we saw him in ADwD suicidal and alcoholic, I honestly would have expected him to relapse and thought this was what the crypt scene was going for, but after SE8E3 I'm scared he is just done and left with mocking Varys with ball jokes. (Edit: I have to retract that bit, I just realized that after the crypts we might very well see something interesting with Tyrion in the last episodes but it illustrates my fears for Arya.)

Looking at the topic at hand now: With all that Arya has been through, I can't help but feeling confused by the ""high note"" this is ending on, I'm still waiting for more than a family reunion, how will she, the formerly hunted, the exile, the traumatized fit into the political hellscape were going to enter? We have to realize: She has to be a big player now, for smallfolk she will be like a hero form their childhood tales, this all really should have ramifications, big ones when looking at the Dany+North allegiance. I don't think she'll like the spot light but it can't be done with a pat on the back.

This feels like events for 3 characters not one and considering we're probably getting another &gt;= 1h battle I'm just concerned Aryas inner workings won't get screen time, but weren't those what made her interesting in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I can also see why the show's going for an outro after the crescendo

Sure! I'd love it, but as I stated – I'm afraid it'll all feel rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;if it's not forthcoming I'll happily concede to a degree of emptiness  around this resolution but I don't think we can judge that yet

I really hope you're right about that …",0

"I really appreciate your suggestion, but I watched a bit of The Expanse and thought it looked god awful. I'm just not into TV. In my life, I've seen maybe 5 or 6 TV shows I thoroughly enjoyed.

I typically have a strong preference for stories that are smaller in scope. With the exception of, like, the MCU and Endgame and all that, I never really like series. I used to be into anime, but now I will pretty much never watch anything that's over 50 episodes; the only ""young adult"" novel series I've ever liked all the way through was the His Dark Materials series (Golden Compass) because it was short and to the point; God of War 2018 is probably the first video game I've ever enjoyed that's been that far into the series. I just prefer stories that don't feel bloated and drawn out, and most TV, including The Expanse in my opinion, feels exactly that way.

I really do appreciate your suggestion and everything you shared, though. I love that passion and I commend you for sharing it, and hope I don't stop you from sharing in the future. C:",0

Cynical answer, but honestly. What the fuck is anybody gonna do about it?

* Russia can't say shit, they've got at *least* equivalents. [Black Dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dolphin_Prison)
* China can't say shit, same reason as Russia.
* The UK is Americas bitch
* The EU is too afraid of upsetting the US.   
They like to talk tough against Donny but do you really think they'll risk losing Americas military backing? Especially over a prison that houses the likes of: 9/11 conspirators, the Boston bomber, The Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh (deceased), O.G. Mack, Thomas Silverstein, and various double-agents?

So I ask again:

What's anybody gonna do about it?

&gt; They are a news organization as much as CNN or NBC. CNN doesn't even label its opinion articles as such - they call them ""analysis"". Can you believe that? Fox news clearly delineates their news and opinion.   
&gt;  
&gt; I find it hilarious that the presence of one singular mainstream news source biased to the right, among the tens of them in existence, triggers you sheep so much. You'd love a left wing monopoly on mainstream media, yet you claim to support the bill of rights. What a joke! 

Personally I think NBC (Maddow is good though) and CNN and 24/7 news channels in general are trash as well, though Fox news is more like literal festering roadkill. They are a right wing propaganda organization through and through. Yes the presence of this one singular mainstream propaganda source is troubling because of how many people are actually duped by this nonsense. The fact that the President gets all of his news from Fox is even worse. If you have to bend reality to fit your worldview then maybe your worldview is flawed, and Fox News manipulates reality like no other organization.",0

You have an amazing Mother behind you who I’m sure is excited and maybe even quietly nervous to see the great things you will do and become. I’ve only known you since xxxx but just like your family and friends I am also proud of you and wish you the best in life...

&amp;#x200B;

Hallo. To be honest I’ll never understand why you ended up hating or treating me the worst over all the guys before and after me when deep down we both know despite both our flaws and the bad shit, which was literally just arguments, we once cared for each other a lot and treated each other better than those of our past relationships. But that’s not what this is about because I can no longer be upset that the woman I fell deeply in love with decided to just flip on, shun and virtually hate me. This is about xxx early for a reason but Happy Birthday. Probably don’t care to read that from me. I remember about xxxx ago I got a text early morning saying you were sad at work because you realized that you finally pushed me to the point of saying “I’m done”. Stated that you figured I wouldn’t be there for your upcoming birthday anymore. I told you to just express how you feel about me for once and that I’d still show up to be there for you because I had given you my word before. Now I’m the one that isn’t welcome there. I’ll always find it hard to believe your age. Still don’t. An ageless Queen. You have wit, intelligence, you have charisma that you hide, you have a lot of potential. I saw a beautiful soul inside you coupled with those brown eyes that had such a strong gravitational pull, it was easy to truly fall in love with you again every time I saw you no matter how upset I was.  I’ll leave you with this. I got robbed on vacation a while back so I lost a lot of things on that phone including memories but I didn’t lose everything on FB. I was talking to my buddy about how I laughed and unexpectedly cried small tears of joy because I had saw some exchanges between us. Some funny and some real moments. One was literally just me asking “you know I have your back”. You reply yes then say that you have mine. Then we both sent each other heart emoji’s like kids do these days. I told him it was the small and simple moments like that, which are the most memorable. With age it is expected that we grow in all aspects. We have trials and tribulations. We experience the good and the bad. We cry tears of joy and tears of pain. We’ve given each other pain but most of all we’ve given each other times of joy. I learn from the pain and let it go, but the joy is what I will cherish and hold onto. I was blessed with you but I did not deserve you then. We didn’t give each other our best but I forgive you for everything and hopefully you’ll find it in your heart to forgive me one day. I hope when your birthday actually comes you enjoy it and that you’re surrounded in a million pillows or with those that truly care for you.",0

"but this way of “subverting expectations” wasn’t a good way to do it. i’m not disagreeing with arya killing NK but it literally makes no sense on how she killed him. a duke would’ve been better because while the ice weapons aren’t effective against valyrian steel or dragon glass, it can still kill a human. 

in regards to the plot armor, there was no need for this much, like i literally can’t think of a show or movie with the same amount of plot armor as this one episode. all of the main characters should’ve died within seconds. if you literally watch the inside the episode D&amp;D literally state that they knew for 3 years that arya would kill NK. with this in mind, 3 years ago they are at maybe season 6. that was wayyyy after the prophecy melisandre told arya in season 3. there’s a disconnect here. 

plus, they could’ve done something with jon and NK other than them looking at each other. i was hoping jon and NK fight it would be cool to see and i would like the episode a lot more. it baffles me to see this amount of people blindly enjoy it because “visuals effects were amazing!”",0

* Courts have identified several factors relevant to determining on which side of that line your activities may fall, including: whether you represent yourself as a dealer in firearms; whether you are repetitively buying and selling firearms; the circumstances under which you are selling firearms; and whether you are looking to make a profit. Note that while quantity and frequency of sales are relevant indicators, courts have upheld convictions for dealing without a license when **as few as two firearms were sold**, or when only one or two transactions took place, when other factors were also present.

Many housewives, grandmother's, pastors, etc etc say that the moral fabric of our country and our young people is going downhill.  While at least when it comes to out of wedlock sex (of which the type is outspokenly opposed) it seems that the trend is exactly the opposite of what they often claim.

I'm not presenting a study or anything, just a general feeling and attitude that I know a lot of the older generation has expressed.  And how that is seemingly exactly the opposite of what we are seeing.  At least when it comes to sex.

I just want to be more active *in general* and like to do these type of things with someone. He goes to the gym once a week, although he's not that keen on sports and exercise and all that. He does it to stay healthy and has a small Sunday routine of spending a morning at the gym. 

If I, or probably most other people for that instance, would want my partner to be more active, whether it be in general or with me, it'd be so f*cked up to go about it this way. It's emotional abuse AND manipulation. 

Honestly, I'd give him an ultimatum: act like a decent human being and potentially encourage you in a positive way to be more active if you'd be up for it. If not, he should leave it be. You can't force your partner to do something they don't want to do. 

OR he can go fuck right off and I'd honestly say, if he doesnt want to listen and keeps going: divorce/ dump his ass. Not worth it. There are a million ways to approach you respectfully about this. What he did is unacceptable. Not to mention he indirectly called you a fatty and tried to embarrass you in public. If that was my spouse, I'd be done with him immediately.

"* How right you are...
* 
* And now on to Facts about Islam: Not my own work: Thanks /u/diamondsonthefloor
* Sharia is the legal system in Islam. It is a body of rules derived from Koran verses and historical narrations of Mohammed's life. Sharia trumps all man-made laws, including our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Muslims believe Sharia applies to everyone, including non-Muslims.
* Sharia is violent, openly bigoted toward non-Muslims, and brutally sexist. It is explicitly opposed to religious freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the free exchange of ideas.
* Sharia is mandatory for Muslims (Koran 5:48). They are not permitted to pick and choose which parts to follow. (Koran 33:36)
* Any government that limits Sharia in any way is the enemy of Allah and must be fought. (Sahih Muslim 1:33, and many more)
* The establishment of Sharia is a fundamental objective of every Muslim. (Koran 9:29)
* Sharia directly violates at least our First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Thirteenth Amendments.
* Large sections of Sharia govern the practice of slavery. Slavery has been a part of Islam since its beginning and is still practiced to this day. The Koran actually devotes more verses to making sure that Muslim men know they can keep women as rape slaves (four) than it does to telling them to pray five times a day (zero). (Koran 33:50, 23:5-6, 8:69)
* Now how many of you want Muslims in our armed forces, our police force, or our government?
* More here: http://archive.is/SEA1P
* A sampling of what the death cult of Islam teaches about women: * * Men are in charge of women. Koran 4:34
* Men decide how women dress. Koran 33:59
* Women can be beaten. Tabari IX:113
* Women are stupid. Sahih Bukhari 6:301
* Women must cover themselves. Koran 24:31 and 33:59
* Women cannot travel without a man. Sahih Bukhari 52:250
* A woman's court testimony is worth only half of a man's. Koran 2:283
* A rape can only be proven by the confirmation of four male witnesses or a confession by the rapist. Koran 24:4
* Rape victims are criminals. http://archive.is/SonV6
* Under Sharia:
* Wives can be beaten. Koran 4:34
* Wives cannot refuse sex. Sunan Ibn Majah 1853
* Raping your wife is allowed. Koran 2:223, Fatwa No. 33597
* Wives can be raped in any position. Sunan Abu Dawud 2159
* Wives should stay in abusive marriages. Sahih Bukhari 72:715
* The most important thing a woman brings to marriage is unrestricted access to her vagina. Sahih Bukhari 62:81
* The Koran devotes MORE verses to making sure that Muslim men know they can keep women as rape slaves (four) than it does to telling them to pray five times a day (zero).
* An imam in South Carolina stated that a husband is the owner and rule of a wife, who must obey him as his prisoner. http://archive.is/wQwW4
* Islamic scholar al-Ghazali says in The Revival of Religious Sciences that a Muslim woman must:
* stay at home
* not go out often
* not be well-informed
* not be communicative with neighbors
* satisfy her husband in everything
* be ready to satisfy her husband's sexual needs at any moment
* Eleven of the twelve countries with the highest rate of discrimination against women are Muslim-majority countries. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXtIUv5i2w
* Islam is hate. Islam is slavery. Islam is death.
* The greatest threat to Islam is an informed population, because only an informed population can undermine the ideology that gives rise to Islam. Read the Koran for yourself. Know what Muslims know - not what they tell you.
* FIGHT BACK by educating yourself and sharing what you've learned with others.",0

Because the enemy of the left is really a unifying national identity. The idea with mass immigration is to break that up and cause divisions that allow them to slowly chip away at the national character and replace it with political warfare between ever more divided factions.

It's going to become more and more difficult in the western world to have a peaceful transfer of power following elections eventually impossible, with each election ending with riots. You can forget about civilised debate on the topics of the day as the left will increasingly use people it's ""racist, sexist and islamophobic"" to criticise to push their agendas.

I know he does a TON of direct to video now because he doesn't want to go broke, but he's the more than likely the most expensive piece of all of those movies.

"I don't think there's really an easy way to describe it. Language is only a proxy for concepts. You just think. When I think about something it's a mixture of associated imagery, and the concept in thinking about. It's in your mind so you just know what it is you're thinking about without having to define it with language. 

I think there's upsides and downsides. I know I can think quickly, and I think there's a certain freedom in being able to think easily about things that you don't have the language to try and describe. On the flip side sometimes the interface between thought and verbal communication is difficult. I often get stuck when talking to people trying to find the right word for something I was thinking about. Often there isn't an easy one. Often it feels like the word is close , but not quite describing what I'm trying to say. If I'm very stressed, it becomes difficult to talk at all. There have been times I've gone literally mute and been unable to say anything until I've calmed down again. As a child I used to stutter, it felt like my brain was going faster than I could translate and say things. If I'm very tired or excited about something I'll stutter sometimes now too.

"I left out quite a bit of detail and probably could have worded it better. There is a main artery through a part of town. 60 km/per hour two lane. We both sped about 65km down the left and right for about 5 miles. Passing people on the right doing about 55-60. I followed her all that way, she started slowing down so I got back in the left lane to pass and maintain my speed. She didn't like that and sped up. 

That's fair to think I was drunk the first time, but then she rode my ass on a merger for a much more busy 3 lane 100km\h bridge. She then tried to pass me over a solid line. Pretty stupid to ride the ass of someone you think is driving erratically and then try to pass them illegally. 

Like I said I wasn't in the right, but neither was she. Told the cop I'd actually be cool if he wanted to write me up for the speeding and possibly something else. Though that he should also check her driving when he gets the camera footage. I mean I honestly wasn't trying to piss her off. She slowed down from 60ish to 30ish and I got out from behind her because I'd be up her ass. So I was just going to pass, but she sped up when I had already gotten about 10-20 metres in front and started signalling that I was getting in front. Had she just continued to slow down I wouldn't have been able to cut her off. There was over a half mile left before I got out to pass her.

I get it I drive like a dick, but she is not much better. She did basically what I did several times before I did it to her. I acknowledged I drove like a jerk to the cop while she tried to play victim. He said he'd go talk to her and get back to me if there were any problems. Wished him well and I haven't seen him since. 

If that doesn't make it a little clearer I'm sorry. I'm a simple man. Might be able to use MS paint to illustrate it better. Though I feel it'd be a waste if both of ours time.",0

"&gt; So she was bad until, gasp she got good enough managed to beat a magical, shape shifting faceless assassin? That’s called character development. She developed over the course of 7 seasons so why are you acting like her abilities are an ass pull?

No, she quite literally won after getting the shit kicked out of her by turning off the lights, not because she was better than the Waif. There was never any indication that she was a particularly skilled great warrior. So your sarcastic comment doesn't do anything but show how shitty you get to strangers online when they disagree with your opinion.

&gt;Lmao what? The Weasley’s were never exceptional the only one that really became anything exceptional was Percy, and that’s why he distanced himself from the family. What was Ron’s great magical power? What was Ginny’s? Or the twins? What feats did their parents have? Molly killed Bellatrix with a disarming charm. The very definition of ‘anti-climatic’. Looks like you know Harry Potter even less than you do ASOIAF.

Here you are just completely wrong, Percy doesn't distance himself from his family because they aren't magically gifted but because his father isn't viewed as ambition and is seen as a ""muggle lover."" Bill Weasley is a curse breaker for Gringots, a job that is described as being very dangerous and requiring NEWTs to do, Bill and Percy were Head Boys and Charlie and Ron were prefects at Hogwarts. Charlie is a Dragon wrangler which is also dangerous and needs powerful magic to keep him somewhat safe. Both the twins are class clowns but when they start their business multiple older wizards are impressed with their magical ability and Hermoine comments on how clever their magical products are, they are also able to use their skill to create powerful defensive magical items that the Ministry uses in the war against Voldermort. Ron is a very capable wizard and very clever, although he prefers to be lazy and doesn't take things seriously, but he is able to destroy two horcruxes and is on the front lines in the Battle for Hogwarts in Deathly Hallows, battling very powerful dark wizards alongside his family. Ginny from early on is described as having a particularly powerful ""bat boagie hex"" in Half-Blood Prince this and her ambition get her on Slughorn's radar as a student that he takes an interest in, she also fights in the First Battle of Hogwarts, aided by Felix Felices and is powerful enough to fight Bellatrix alongside Hermoine and Luna. Molly and Arthur are active members, and have been since the original incarnation, of the Order of the Phoenix; Arthur shows great skill in charming things like the Ford Anglier which is so magically charmed by him that it develops sentience when it begins living in the forbidden forest. Finally Molly's abilities are greatly enhanced by love, which is a type of magic that Bellatrix does not respect nor know the true power of, Bellatrix's hubris and Molly's love for her children and Harry are a powerful combination that cause Bellatrix's downfall. 

Molly doesn't kill Bellatrix with a disarming charm, the spell she casts that kills Bellatrix isn't uttered but Molly is channelling enough magic that the ground beneath her cracks from the intensity of it.

"I didn't downvote you, since your point is relevant to the discussion, but I fundamentally disagree. There are so many good arguments in favor of not circumcising a baby, OP should have picked up a stronger argumentation. Saying ""I have a dick, so I decide"" is unreasonable and something an asshole says, even if it is against circumcision. 

Additionally, there are also always better options than resorting to low level of discussion with your partner. OP's wife/gf was extremely insulting and I don't know if they can come back from her calling his dick disgusting, but it's unproductive to keep arguing in an uncivilized manner if OP wants to raise a baby with her in a stable environment. If your partner ever insults you and you wanna stay, leave for a while, everyone cools off and you address what happened in a civilized way. Just responding with equal spite gets you nowhere and makes you a contributor to a toxic environment.

Regarding your argument, you can always take the high road when someone wrongs you. If your partner cheats on you, you can just choose to leave them and block them. Or you can key their car or slap them out of spite. The last options also make you an asshole despite not initiating, because there is no need to behave like that.",0

"I guess I'm both referring to both: 

- the sequencing of the layers of their defenses around Winterfell
- their use of light cavalry as though they were shock cavalry, and we've seen the use of both effectively in the series, between Stannis and the Vale Knights, and the Dothraki

For point one, as I've said in some other comments.. they have Unsullied spear troops in front of stakes? And artillery in front of fixed defensive emplacements? Why did they even build trebuchets as a defending force? They fired them like, once. 

The dead are basically like cavalry, so the fire trench and the stakes are great, but.. why lose any soldiers before making them deal with getting over the pointy stakes while getting stabbed by 2-3 ranks of Unsullied spears, and pushed off with shields? Instead, the fixed defenses worked against the Unsullied, by funneling and slowing their retreat, sacrificing their front ranks for the lives of the back ranks.

If they're clever enough to have these defences, they should at least use them in a non-ridiculous way.

For point 2, we know that the Dothraki have bows, and not armored horses, and we know the AotD has a huge numbers advantage and can't be ""injured"", so.. beyond the budget limitations, why did they charge them? The Dothraki should clearly be familiar with hit and run tactics. They're based on Mongols/Huns, and that's the basis of their approach to warfare - mobile, and ranged.",0

"The kinds of wattages needed to kill things like unplugged batteries in the size of just a city would be so staggeringly high I'd be surprised if secondary radiation didn't also wipe out all living things in a similar radius. 

The way emp does damage is exciting currents in metal and thus expressing a voltage, but that voltage is directly related to the length of the metal acting as an antenna picking up the signal. Power distribution networks get damaged far easier than standalone electronics because the wires along streets act like huge antennas. A battery has fuck all metal in it, similar with a computer etc. These devices are typically damaged by voltage spikes on their plug.

So no, almost certainly most things like generators that are for the most part mechanical devices would not be damaged, especially when considering their locations (basements for the most part). If they did I think you'd find the radiation output would probably kill more everything alive than the emp alone.",0
"First of all, for the third fucking time, I’m not against it. If anything, you arguing against someone on your side, bringing partisan politics into it, and lashing out at the other side just shows how difficult it is to work with people like you and accomplishes anything.

"Yes, you’re creating a strawman by (intentionally?) misinterpreting or assigning your own definition to what I’ve said. I’m a police officer. I’m well aware of training and tactics.

"Barr literally copied and pasted Mueller's conclusions for ""quick release,"" and then went through the rest of the report and redacted portions that the law required him to, releasing the redacted version in a timely manner, and releasing a less redacted portion to Democrats in Congress. He didn't mislead anyone or cover anything up.  He wasn't even required to release the report at all.

If Mueller didn't want his conclusions characterized in a particular way, *he should have not done so in the report he provided to Barr.*

I'm no Trump supporter. I wish Merrick Garland were on the Supreme Court. But from a moderate viewpoint, this smells of the media covering its ass for completely blowing it on the collusion coverage for 2 years. 

Seriously. The big complaint is that the ""summary wasn't nuanced enough, even though we got the full report shortly thereafter and could make our own conclusions.""

Except that Dany, Sansa, and everyone else have already been bickering endlessly about what to do.

There was already a debate and a conflict about how to deal with Cersei.

But, as mentioned, I made my arguments based on the principle that every individuum should have as many freedoms and rights as possible, and imprisonment should only take away the freedoms and rights that are absolutely necessary to keep the system working.

However, the problem is he made it about how as a black man he shouldn't have to do it, even if other people do.  That just doesn't come across very well, even if you think the informal rules are stupid.

"It turns out Jon and Dany were never Targaryens. Their real blood lineage is the Uchiha clan. At the end, Cersei's army is too powerful and he has no choice but to kill Dany and take her eyes to awaken the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. Cersei is then cornered, but at the last moment, she summons Godhands using the Egg of the Behelit and sacrifices everyone in King's Landing. Jon is now no match for Cersei who has become a literal demon god.  But don't worry! Arya has trained in the hyperbolic time chamber and now has ascended super saiyan. She creates a giant spirit bomb, but Cersei avoids getting hit since she is able to manipulate dimensional portals. At this point Bran wargs into Cersei and takes control over her body. But he cannot hold her for too long. He begs Arya and Jon to kill him. Jon and Arya uses a Rasengan Kamehameha attack and destroys Cersei, killing Bran in the process. Jon becomes Hokage.

Westeros is saved, but with great cost. It is a bittersweet ending.",0
"My dad never even heard the word ""poc"" and he still was like ""now theyre killing all the foreigners""... The dothraki dying somehow makes me the saddest of all the deaths in the episode - away in a strange land, never even given a PoV in their final moments, sent out to die as canon fodder with noone mourning them.

Its extra annoying because they even touched upon the topic of racism/xenophobia in the north, but then they have greyworm and missandei say they have no place in westeros and want to go, and now all the armies have been wiped out... Pretty much saying that foreigners cant have a place in white westeros. But looking at actual european history, there have always been nonwhite people settling there even in bigger numbers (hungary, balkan...), and asoiaf itself even has the rhoynar in dorne, and it seems so lazy that they just ""get rid"" of the unsullied and dothraki like that.

I hope future episodes somehow rectify this, but im not sure how they could do that or if they even noticed the problem.",0

"I disagree. There have been a few minorities that overcame this. Homosexuals and Asians and up and coming minority, Indians and other Polynesians as well.

Being poor isn’t the problem, is a culture that perpetuates a victim mentality. Our society didn’t create anything, they did that to themselves.

u/Zenguy2828 - there are a ton of banks that offer fee less banking. Simple Bank as an example. What you mention is just poor personal financial management. That falls in the shoulders of the individual, not society.

Also insulting minorities that can actually take care of themselves and thrive by calling them “model minorities” is stupid. They are simply living their lives well and making good decisions. Just because other minorities refuse to accept that does make them model minorities, it just means that they have a better culture within their lifestyle sphere. In other words, you shouldn’t be criticizing minorities that do well, you should criticize minorities that do poorly for not doing enough. It’s just an excuse.",0

"Oh yeah, and to corroborate the other response you received, Mueller did not investigate collusion and rule one way or another.

On obstruction, Mueller reported:

&gt;Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgement. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.

Mueller is essentially saying that there reeks of obstruction, there's evidence of obstruction, and he cannot adequately rule it out; but there are obstacles for him from further investigating. So he shined a light, saw some suspicious things, but not enough to prove anything, and had to turn the light off before adequately clearing the room—so to speak. 

Next on **Collusion vs Conspiracy vs Coordinated:**

Let's try to unpack what Mueller's report means when they write:

&gt;In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of ""collusion.**[1] In so doing, the Office recognized that the word ""collud[ e ]"" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.** For those reasons , **[2] the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.** In connection with that analysis, **[3] we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign ""coordinat[ ed]""-a term that appears in the appointment order-with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, ""coordination"" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law.** 

&gt;**[4]We understood coordination to require an agreement-tacit or express - between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests.** We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

[1] - Mueller is noting that Collusion is not a Federal statute and is highlighting its blatant use in the media (as well as from Trump).

[2] - Mueller is noting that the closest match based on the directive of the Special Counsel in the first is Conspiracy, which *is* a possible Federal crime

[3] - Mueller is highlighting that the initial order to form the Special Counsel emphasized investigating ""coordination"" between the Russian Government and Donald Trump

[4] - Coordination under the purview of conspiracy required an explicit agreement *to* coordinate, as opposed to both reading what the others were doing, reacting to in a means to mutually benefit each other. This is the kind of nonsense SuperPACs run under by funneling unlimited amounts of money to support a candidate without direct coordination, but obviously with an **implicit** intent to (a) further the agendas of the SuperPAC, and (b) advance the campaign of the candidate.  


Some questions going forward:

- Would Trump Supporters care that both Russia and Trump indirectly coordinated? Especially given Trump said, ""Russia, if you're listening...""?

- What aspect of ""collusion"" or related charges may have been handed off in the sealed 12 other investigations?

- How can ignorance be a defense for those of the Trump campaign?

- On obstruction, why *explicitly* could Mueller's team not ""reach that judgement"" on obstruction, and what ""difficult issues"" are you referring to which prevent ruling out the occurrence of any criminal conduct?",0

You might not be willing to crash your car into a wall, but if someone else side swipes you and your bleeding out in the passenger seat, you might be okay with it, instead of fearing what's next you just understand what's next is inevitable whether it's right now or 60 years from now it's always going to arrive, and you don't feel so well right now and you don't think it will ever get better, so maybe bleeding to death is an opportunity, there is nothing you can do about it, it isn't up to you and in the end it might be better than forever trying to cling onto life in the hopes it will get better. You might be resigned to just sit there and let it happen rather than fight it or maximize your survivability.",0

"While I can completely understand your opinion, and even agree with certain aspects of it, I do think there is a fair amount of undue angst from some viewers because things didn’t go how they expected. I honestly expected NK to end/die that episode because this is Game of Thrones, not The Long Night. We may have all thought NK worked as a final villain, but the entirety of this story is about the Throne. In fact, I think I would have been pissed if the NK ended up making it south and winning the throne or even worse, dying then. That would’ve been useless. You talking about a waste of years of story..
I know a lot of people don’t like that, and are very disappointed in that because Cersei seems childish compared to the “real threat”, but from a story standpoint, it’s a crux point. Everything changes now because of this battle. Those in the battle can’t forget what happened, and that changes people. Now we get to see further development and the real game comes to an end. There is still a lot of development that is coming from both characters and plot/story resolution. How does Dany deal with Jon? How does Sansa deal with Dany? Does Jon claim his heritage? What does Jaime do regarding his destroyed family? All these answers hinge on them living past the NK. And now we get to find out.

“Friends of Hamas” and Andrew Breitbart’s Legacy

By Alex Koppelman February 20, 2013

The philosopher Karl Popper once said, “Every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it.” He was talking about science and philosophy, but he could have been talking about journalism, too. At its best, reporting is like science: you form a hypothesis, and you try to prove it. But as importantly—more importantly—you shoot it full of holes to see if any of the wounds are fatal. This, unfortunately, is a lesson that a certain part of the conservative media doesn’t seem to have learned yet.

The most recent example of this issue, of course, is the suddenly infamous “Friends of Hamas” story. About two weeks ago, Breitbart News editor-at-large Ben Shapiro reported:

&gt; On Thursday, Senate sources told Breitbart News exclusively that they have been informed that one of the reasons that President Barack Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, has not turned over requested documents on his sources of foreign funding is that one of the names listed is a group purportedly called “Friends of Hamas.”

There was, it turns out, a problem with the story: Friends of Hamas does not exist, and never has. Slate’s Dave Weigel did the work to prove this last week, and on Wednesday, the New York Daily News’ Dan Friedman followed up, disclosing that he was, by way of a jokey hypothetical apparently filtered through Capitol Hill’s version of the telephone game, the source for the idea that Friends of Hamas existed and that it might in some way be connected to Chuck Hagel.

It may have taken a couple weeks and the work of a couple good reporters for Friends of Hamas’s non-existence and Shapiro’s grievous mistake to be definitively proven, but the flaw in Shapiro’s post was evident as soon as it was published, and should have been clear to him even before that. The day that Shapiro’s story first came out, I searched both Google and Lexis-Nexis to find information about Friends of Hamas; the only records of its existence I was able to find were Shapiro’s post and links to it. That wasn’t definitive proof that the group didn’t exist, but it was a strong indicator, and anyone else who took the five or ten minutes necessary to conduct those searches would have seen the same thing. Yet Shapiro and Breitbart.com went ahead with the report anyway, and a significant number of outlets on the right, from radio shows and blogs to the National Review, picked up the news and ran with it based on nothing more.

Now, Shapiro and Breitbart.com are refusing to admit that Shapiro made a serious mistake, and attacking anyone who suggests otherwise. This kind of behavior from them is unsurprising, and not just because it’s an outgrowth of the worldview and strategy of their founder, Andrew Breitbart. (For more on Breitbart, who died last year, see Rebecca Mead’s Profile of him from 2010.) To be embarrassed about the story, they’d have to understand that the hypothesis of Shapiro’s story was “Chuck Hagel may have been the recipient of funding from a group called Friends of Hamas,” and they’d have to care about proving it true. Their version of the hypothesis is much simpler, and more vicious: “Someone told us that Chuck Hagel may have been the recipient of funding from a group called Friends of Hamas.” This has the virtue, from a certain perspective, of being completely unfalsifiable—as soon as the source gave them the tip, the story was true by definition and in perpetuity, no matter what.

There is no reporter who is incapable of error, no established media outlet without a black mark or twenty on its record. But those are generally mistakes or aberrations; this is the Breitbart.com way of doing business. Where journalists are researchers, they see themselves as warriors, picking up Breitbart’s hashtagged mantle #WAR. With that mindset, the kind of rigor they demand from the mainstream media becomes a hindrance.

It’s not often that one sees the kind of blatant disregard for the truth involved in the Friends of Hamas story. Still, even as the right has made more of an effort to establish its own journalistic endeavors, conservative media outlets, in practice, are still failing all too often to properly vet their stories. Never has this been more evident than during the Hagel confirmation fight. Obviously, there’s something to be said for tenaciousness, especially when it comes to checking into someone who is slated to become one of the most important people in the American government. But there’s a difference between dogged reporting and reporting that pretends even the most meager evidence—loose paraphrases, faded memories, suggestions—is definitive proof. Nor has this been limited to Hagel.

Late last year, the Weekly Standard’s Daniel Halper (who has been one of Hagel’s most insistent pursuers lately) wrote a blog post about questions that NBC anchor David Gregory had posed to the N.R.A.’s Wayne LaPierre’s about the latter’s proposal to put armed guards in schools. Halper reported:

&gt; But when it comes to Gregory’s own kids, however, they are secured every school day by armed guards.
&gt; 
&gt; The Gregory children go to school with the children of President Barack Obama, according to the Washington Post. That school is the co-ed Quaker school Sidwell Friends.
&gt; 
&gt; According to a scan of the school’s online faculty-staff directory, Sidwell has a security department made up of at least 11 people. Many of those are police officers, who are presumably armed.
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, with the Obama kids in attendance, there is a secret service presence at the institution, as well.

(This report later worked its way into an N.R.A. ad about President Obama’s children.)


It’s true, of course, that there is a Secret Service detail protecting the Obama children, even when they’re at school. But the bits about Gregory’s kids being “secured every school day by armed guards,” and about Sidwell’s security department and members of it being armed? Well, that’s just not true, as the Post’s Glenn Kessler documented. Moreover, Halper had every reason to be wary, and to do some careful reporting before publishing his story—Sidwell is, as he noted, a Quaker school, and Quakers are well known for pacifism. (Richard Nixon excepted.) Again, as in Shapiro’s case, that fact alone isn’t proof that Sidwell security wouldn’t carry guns, but it should have been obvious to Halper that it was at least a potentially serious flaw in his hypothesis. He went ahead with his story anyway; as of now, it remains, despite Kessler’s report, without any sort of update or correction. (Halper didn’t respond to an e-mail requesting comment.)

At some point, if they want to be taken more seriously, members of the conservative media will have to take their own declarations about the commitment to journalism more seriously. More importantly, they’ll have to realize that reporting isn’t just the means to a desired political end; done right, it’s the end in itself, no matter what it digs up.",0

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

So every Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, the garbage has to go out to the street. My mom  (45F) will usually pester me (17M) to do it at like 7pm Tuesday and onwards when the garbage truck doesn’t even come until 10am Wednesday. There’s two huge bins that go from the back of the house all the way to the end of the driveway. Most of our neighbors bring their bins back like ten minutes after the garbage truck comes. 

Usually I just bring the garbage back at around 9pm or in the morning an hour before the garbage truck comes. The problem is bringing the garbage bins back. She wants me to bring the garbage back almost directly after the garbage truck comes. It gets really annoying because more times than not, I bring the garbage out at night so I’m sleeping at 10 in the morning. I’m in online school so I don’t have to get yo early for school or anything btw. 

She’ll bang on my door for five minutes straight and text me in all caps “yelling” because I haven’t gotten the garbage. 

Anyways, today I was gone from 9am-7pm. When I got home she started yelling at me to take the garbage bins to the backyard. I told her I will after I change and put my things away. I had a huge duffel bag and I was dressed in nice clothes. Plus, it was drizzling and muddy outside and I was stressed because I didn’t rest all day. So I just wanted to change into pajamas and slides before I did it. But she didn’t agree with that. She said “NO, GET THEM NOW!! WE ARE THE ONLY ONES ON THE STREET WITH THE GARBAGE STILL OUT. ITS FUCKING EMBARRASSING” So I said “If it’s that embarrassing then you should’ve taken them while I was gone” 

Then I went to my room to change and all that and she started blowing up my phone in all caps. I still haven’t gotten the garbage because i think she’s being unreasonable as fuck. I deal with this every week so I can’t tell if I just got lazy and I’m the asshole or if she’s being the asshole. If it were me with my future kids, I wouldn’t be sitting on my ass all day (my mom doesn’t work) waiting until they get home so I can yell at them to take the garbage because it’s bothering me. 

So AITA?

Except one time like 18 months ago when he wouldn’t shower for days at a time (he was 14 at the time) and we pretty much had to convince him he was going to get gang green in his dick if he didn’t start washing it and then he wouldn’t have anything.. 

As someone who is planning to start a family with their partner, I personally believe it is a decision my partner and I will need to make together, but as he is a MALE and has a PENIS, his opinion on the matter is extremely important, not because mine doesn’t count, but because he’s had to live his whole life with his dick, I want to know what he thinks is better and why..",0

"His forces have gone up against Jon multiple times before, every time they've failed to kill him. He knows Jon and has seen him on several occasions, at this point he probably wants to be done with him once and for all. He could have also had his wights kill Bran and kept a safe distance but he wanted to be the one to deal the final blow as it seemed personal. The NK is also arrogant about his invulnerability - he stares down Dany as she blasts him with dragon fire and when Theon charges at him, he doesn't even both to use his own weapon (in fact I don't think he once unsheathes his weapon in the entire show). 

I think the annoyance with Jon's persistence and his arrogance would be enough to allow the fight, wanting to strike the final blow to Jon as he wants to do with Bran and as he did do with the previous TER.",0

It’s a good time for Halo, but that’s not because the series was in dire straits and MS pumped more money into it, it was already doing well.

The MSM will try to say something dumb about global warming and forest fires, or some stupid shit, but the rank and file union members love Trump because they know he loves first responders. The Union bosses get paid huge amounts of money to shill for Dems, yet this doesn't represent the rank and file or their interests. Unions should not make political endorsements as they represent members of all political ideologies. They should only focus on working with elected officials to better the lives of their members.

The protagonist in Ready Player One (novel, not film) suffers this.

Despite this the character itself was, while powerful enough to win, not overpowered to an extreme.

"Me too, it’s very tasty. I differentiate between sauces that are “food” and sauces that are “challenges”. 

Challenge sauces are usually extract sauces (that’s a no from my dawg) and, like Da Bomb, serve only one purpose - pain and suffering. 

Other sauces, like the Last Dab, are made from pure pepper mash and mixed with other ingredients to create a tasty flavour. Even at the highest levels of world record breaking heat, I’ve found myself amazed at the differences in flavour between peppers. Pepper X is different to Reapers which are different to Ghosts and Scorpions. They’re all unique and delicious. 

So while the Last Dab is much hotter on the Scoville scale than Da Bomb, because it’s natural and made to be extremely hot but also tasty and edible, it warrants much less of a reaction than extract sauces.

Also, Inhumans show suck! Most of characters are unlikable heroes and they support slavery which I don't think Cap would approved of it. Their acting especially Crystal are awful. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

The show killed any potential of seeing Inhumans in MCU movie and ABC was not proud with the show that they ultimately cancelled the show before it can second season.

Red Lakes Shooting- Killed family member and took guns

Marysville Shooting- Acquired gun from family member 

Sante Fe Shooting- Acquired guns from family member 

And for good measure Sandy Hook was killing a family member as well

It's certainly possible a student could assault a teacher and take the gun, personally I'd prefer the firearm be kept in a secure safe in the class room as a possible good will gesture to those with concerns.

Dany walks towards her newly won throne drinking her prized slushie. She trips, the slushie flying straight towards the throne. Cut to flashbacks of her visions, the throne covered in ice and snow. Cut back to an extreme closeup of Dany's eyes, wide and widening still. Cut to the slushie, still in mid-air, falling in slow motion. Then, from the shadows, Arya falls from the sky and stabs the slushie before it can hit the throne, saving the world from the final Long Night, and Dany's sweet ass from a bit of cold, sugary water.

Dany then makes Arya Hand of the Queen and simultaneously Captain of the Queen's guard, but Arya turns it down. ""A girl needs no title."" Close up of Arya's face. She winks, smirks, turns, and walks away, leaving King's Landing to go adventuring.

And where does she go? Tune in to HBO in 5 years for the Arya spin-off series!",0

"I see how frustrating that is, but to me this isn't a Hard SciFi or Fantasy story. In the world of GOT just about no one understands many of the magical elements, even those who wield them. It's a crazy world without limits because the magic is not mapped out and understood. The warlocks in that Tower sure seemed to think that they had everything under control yet they were defeated by literally the one thing everyone knows dragons will do: fire breath. The characters in this world never know anything for certain and we, the audience, are right there with them, grasping at rumors and holding on to hope.

&amp;#x200B;

It wouldn't feel right if we had a 3 season subplot of Sam hunting down the specific mechanics by which dragon glass and the magic swords are able to kill the White Walkers. Like could you imagine?

&amp;#x200B;

 Jon getting a raven and reading aloud to the Onion Knight the secret of Valyrian Steel and how the origin of Dragons ties in with the origin of magic in this world. Then they go into the Dragon Glass Cave and he and the dragon queen spend a whole scene deciphering a history of The Doom of Valyria and realize it has everything to do with the creation of Valyrian Steel. Then they have a tense back and forth about the risks of trying to replicate the process to give themselves every advantage. Jon fills in some more technical information about how exactly Dragon Glass can be used and then they sketch out the details of a grand plan to use the dragon glass including the potential weaknesses and counters they could encounter. During the final confrontation Jon realizes the true  power of his Valyrian Steel was inside him all along; He doesn't say so but instead we watch it happen from the vantage point of Onion Knight and Tyrion who discuss what must be going through his mind and how this is exactly what they need to happen for The Living to prevail. Jorah shouts as he protects the woman he loves. Shouts a bold declaration of his love and why that gives him the strength to fight on. She pleads to him 'Senpai! you can't leave me like this. Its too much, I can see your \[insert specific fatal injurty\]. Then she cries and another character walks up to conveniently allow her to monologue about her emotions.

from your post, it seems pretty cut and dry on her end. she didn't follow up to see if you were still going to come, as soon as the other dude bailed, it was dead. 

This could be her going after the other guy, this could be her *literally* just wanting to study, this could be a million other things, cause who knows what's going on in her life, you apparently don't.

This seems all very straight forward to me, only interaction is within your group, no walking and talking after class, no texting or any conversation other than school.... 

buttttttttt I digress, you **HAVE** to shoot your shot or you'll be forever wondering ""what if""

The easiest way to ease into the ""more than friends"" path is via social settings. If you have friends you go out with, invite her out as well, tell her to bring some friends too. A simple ""hey anon! a couple of us are going out to \[insert anything\] today/tonight, if you've got nothing going on, you should come out too! feel free to bring some of your friends too if you'd like""

Everyone is different, maybe she's not into the party scene, maybe she'd be more for grabbing coffee or tea, maybe she's married with kids, seeing as how you don't even know how old she is, she is a mystery right now! 

only way to find out is to take the leap and shoot your shot.

"Sure, that would subvert expectation, but it wouldn't make any sense. People are acting like Arya being the one killing NK is so out of bounds, and so unrealistic when it really isn't at all. There is plenty of character development to support it. What you are saying is the equivalent of Frank Hvam's character sitting on the Iron Throne by the end of the series.

The ammo manufacturers made so much money on those sales, they were able to upgrade manufacture and sold tons more!!

The rule of unintended effects, and of the markets is very hard for the leftists to figure out. Like Carter's and MADuro's ""price controls"", which both drove off goods and services from the markets.

"This is probably a common fear, but...terrorist attacks (idk if school shootings are considered terrorist attacks but I'm including them too). I'm in college, and it's something I think about relatively often. When I'm in class, I sometimes find myself thinking about where the exits are in the room and building that I'm in, and where some good hiding places might be if I ever need them. When I'm in a school building (or even my own apartment sometimes) and the fire alarm goes off, I'm hesitant to get up and join the pack of people heading for the exit because I know that these days, someone my age/demographic is more likely to die in a shooting/terrorist attack than in a fire, and if it is an attack then I don't want to be congregating out in the open. I also tend to get suspicious of people walking around campus more than I should. Like if I see a white guy in a long, heavy coat carrying a weird briefcase-type thing, I'll notice immediately and panic internally for a few seconds before I realize that he's walking into the music building, so what he's carrying is probably an instrument case, and then I""ll think ""It IS 50 degrees outside, so I guess the coat makes sense."" Maybe all of that is normal. Maybe those are regular safety precautions I should be taking. Feel free to let me know your thoughts. But personally, I don't think that's something most 20 year olds should have to think about regularly. Obviously, I don't know if it will happen at my school, but I know it will happen somewhere, and it could be here.",0

From the 2015 report, section F26 (page 205) the CEO was the highest compensated employee and was paid 18.18M NOK (inclusive of accrued pension benefits) which is $2.11M at the current exchange rate.

On the other side there are no condoms that protect you from gunshot wounds. Also getting shot at is not consented while having sex inside a marriage is. Then again, sex without consent happens independently of gay marriage. Where to go on? Sex is something completely natural, even a basic need for most life forms while killing because of hate or out of desire is something not even an animal would do.

I mean, seriously, how can someone compare marriage and sex (something that happens out of love), no matter if gay or straight, with mass shootings? It really boggles my mind.

edit: also wanted to add that even unprotected sex doesn't spread AIDS when it happens inside a marriage with a single sex partner so it doesn't make any sense to relate gay marriage with spreading AIDS. Are there even any statistics that correlate gay marriage and HIV infections? Did you also know that people are having sex without being married? Shocking, isn't it?",0

Also the fact that main characters were put in situations that they should've died although their plot armour essentially saved them. As for Jon not fighting the NK, I don't think that's an issue since he did have an actual confrontation and why would he NK risk getting hit when Jon was irrelevant to his plans. Just becausr Jon dedicated his lift to defeat the NK doesn't mean the NK actually gives a shit about him. Game of Thrones has consistently not given fans exactly what they want and I'd argue Jon killing the NK or having a final battle with the NK kind of cliché and expected.",0

\- You went on your dream holiday with someone you loved.

\- You then defended them morally and as loyally as you could possibly do so, without being asked to. They lied to you, broke your heart, and then pushed the blame onto you behind your back. 

\- You maturely decided to reach out to a friend of his, without lying about him, spreading shit, and you decided you would be open and honest about it. 

\- Turns out he not only lied and the rest, but he's been cheating on you for a while, and now he wants to get back to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have done everything in such a cool, calm and collected way. Even if under the surface your legs are kicking frantically, you look like a swan above the water. You're obviously incredibly mature and rational, and that in itself is impressive in this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think you should reach out to someone you trust, or several people you trust, and book some very easy going activities with them over the coming weeks. Picnics, maybe go for a walk together, get in touch with your local dog pound and maybe even take their puppies for a walk. Get yourself out of the rut you're currently in, and try to clear your head. 

&amp;#x200B;

This guy is worthless. He knows it. He's trying to hold on to you, and he can't because you are so much better than him. Make it a clean break. Cut him off on all social media/communications, and try to piece your life back together. Be open with everyone you meet in the same calm, clear way you have been, and it'll start to get easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

So, my sister (we'll call her S) used to be a college student and just finished up her 1st (and most likely last) year. As of today she is on academic suspension and will not be allowed to attended classes for a semester because of her poor performance. S wanted to be a mechanical engineer and was majoring in that, but due to the fact that she never passed her general classes never got to take any classes in that area. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole week S has been crying and bitching when ever someone talked to her. Telling everyone that it's ""unfair"" and that her teachers are the reason she did so bad. She has somehow convinced my mom that one of the teacher verbally harassed her. Everyone has been supporting her and trying to ""help her through this hard time"".

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, S is lying. I go to the same school as she does and am 2 years ahead of her. I know for a fact that she never went to class or did any of the work. The first time she started crying saying that her teacher was mean to her I went and talked to him. The ""verbal harassment"" was sitting down with her during his office hours to tell her she statistically cannot pass his class due to not even showing up to the midterm. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has failed 6 of the 8 classes she took and the ones she passed were with c-. Because of this she was suspended for 1 semester and cannot fail again.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night when we got confirmation she began to rant saying that her teachers were against her and that it's their fault. I told her no, it's not. She is just lazy and didn't want to put in any effort and now is playing the victim. We argued for almost an hour before she stormed away crying when I told her that she is the stereotypical sheltered child who will fail at life.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are mad at me and say that I wen't over board. I don't think so though. AITA?

"Part of me also thinks this situation is completely over simplified. As soon as you condense any topic down you tend to loose things in the process that may make the situation sound worse than it is. The only way to truly get to the bottom of the situation is through therapy and an open mind. This sub needs to remember that specifically because there is always two sides to a story and what actually happened. The husband calling her a whore could be a gross oversimplification of "" I see you looking at other men all the time"". I don't say this to contradict OP, but to expose people to the fact that things like that happen all the time. I doubt in OP's writing this, all of what they said is 100% factual, 100% unbiased, and 100% correct. I doubt the guy is 100% the asshole OP makes him out to be; you also have to recognize OP may have had enough of their relationship and is just looking for validation to end it.

But gut feelings and instinctive responses to stories aren't rational.

"The ‘intent to blow’ provision is referenced in 31.2:

As there is a human factor involved in blowing the whistle to stop play, the Referee may deem the play to be stopped slightly prior to the whistle actually being blown. The fact that the puck may come loose or cross the goal line prior to the sound of the whistle has no bearing if the Referee has ruled that the play had been stopped prior to this happening.

And in 78.5:

Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer […] when the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle.

Nothing in the rules about erroneous whistles...

If the ref HAD blown the whistle before it crossed then it shouldn't be a goal from my interpretation, but in this case it was a goal.",0

&gt; Your friend of 20 something years is out partying a little too hard. His girlfriend is upset and wants to go home. He calls her a bitch and she storms off.

And maybe he's not incorrect at some core level, but the context is important. But instead of causing an even bigger scene, damaging the long friendship, and getting nothing accomplished, you just shrug your shoulders and wait for an opportunity when he's sober.

Barr could have been technically accurate but still have left out enough context to allow his summary to be misinterpreted. And when Mueller says that the media misinterpret some people are skewing that in the direction of the ""mass media"" aka ""the leftist media"". But it's just as easy to see that Fox News and the media on the right could have equally misinterpreted things creating competing narratives. This is what we saw. Some parts of the media excoriating Barr for the bias they saw and other parts celebrating the exoneration the President based on what Barr presented. Then when the report hit they continued to follow the lines they were well-anchored to. 

It's all politics. Barr, Mueller, no one involved here is entirely a political. Even the ones that are fighting hard to get it right still have to do a political dance. Barr either is incapable of doing that dance publicly, or he's only dancing for one person. That's the crux of the problem.",0

"Well i’d Like to see that happen then. I’ll be laughing when he doesn’t get impeached and also gets re-elected. 

“Many Americans are stupid” &lt;- it’s precisely this line of thought that got him elected in the first place. Americans aren’t stupid, they voted for Trump because they believed he had their own interests in mind more than Hilary. It’s not that Trump was good, it’s the the democrats are so far removed from the reality and how the everyday Americans are feeling that Trump seemed like the better candidate. As long as people treat them like they don’t know what they’re talking about, they’re going to resist and become more attracted to the other side. 

Americans like the free market and they like thinking hard work pays off. Democrats are out of step with that, so they’re out of step with Americans. In a democracy, the better candidate doesn’t win, the one who appears better wins and this sort of attitude of yours is exactly why Trump won in the first place. Its not that the Average American isn’t doing anything, it’s that the average American doesn’t hold the same ideology so they don’t see any benefit to doing anything. 

Trump has his political positions because that’s what people want to hear, not that it’s the best thing for America or society at large. The fact that democrats think it’s more important to hold on to principles instead of playing the same game is why the republicans got power in the first place and it’s also why impeaching Trump is a bad idea. 

I won’t stupid for it because it seems to make sense but it’s off mark from the reality of the situation. Reddit might be on board in general, but Reddit doesn’t reflect America or the world at large, it skews towards demographics that aren’t as politically significant as reddit seems. But you people don’t want to leave your little thought bubble so you’re going to continue to be baffled by how this unfolds.

If Americans cared about what you’re talking about, this would have been an issue a long time ago. But they don’t, so this is just going to reflect badly on those people. When you make a power move and it’s not effective, you look ineffective and that’s what’s going to happen if they keep pushing on this. 

These people you call cowards may be downfall in your vision for America, but they're the ones who are going to determine the trajectory of the country. It’s not sham that Americans don’t live up to your principles, it’s a sham that you think they ever lived up to them in the first place.",0

"And everyone in turkey knows the coup was plotted by gulen movement.

The opposition has been warning erdogan for decades about gulenists. National security council declared them an enemy of the state which is trying to infiltrate government and military ranks with an aim to take over and and install a sharia regime back in 2003. And they partially succeeded. With the help of erdogan, gulenists successfully infiltrated the military, judicial system, police organization, and started their fake coup trials back in 2007 in order to get rid of kemalist generals and open the career path for their recruits. All the generals who participated in the 2015coup were fasttracked to being a general during those days. 

Erdogan disregarded all these warnings and allied himsepf with gulenist movement. Akp itself helped people from gulenist movement infiltrate every branch of government. Akp itself placed all the sackep people into those positions.

After gulenists and erdogan started to show differences, gulenists declared war on him exposing his dirty laundry. Erdogan did not take this well and started sacking gulenists.  Before the coup they already had extensive lists about gulenists people and their positions, all because erdogan himself placed all those people there.

The coup happened as a response to an expected wave of arrests of gulenist generals in the military which was going to happen the next morning. They were cornered and had to rush the coup expecting the kemalist generals who also hate erdogan would join them. Kemalists did not join the coup attempt and gulenists were left open and helpless, hence the reason why the coup was so amateurish.

At that point erdogan declared state of emergency which gave him enough power to accelerate the sacking of gulenists. They were able to sack that many people because, 

1)they helped these islamist cult infiltrate themselves, akp itself let these dogs in

2)akp has been sacking these islamist cultists at a much slower rate already before the coup attempt. The lists were already there and akp was going slowly to not cause a big uproar.",0

"&gt; a generic Hollywood hero story

IDK how people still think this. What happened with EP03 was, if nothing else, exactly what you wouldn't expect from a generic Hollywood hero story. That doesn't mean it was necessarily good, but it sure as hell isn't what happens in your Hollywood blockbusters. 

They killed what you thought was the big bad halfway through the season. In the generic Hollywood story, Jon Snow meets the NK in a dramatic 1v1 sword fight in the fiery ruins of the Red Keep's Throne Room, in the last episode, after crashing their dragons into it, and the dragons are on (wild)fire. 

However, there's a reason why those generic plots keep being re-used, its' because, at least on a surface level, for TV, they often work. So ""not generic"" doesn't automatically equal good, or vice versa. 

I have serious doubts OP's theory will happen, but with 4 hours of footage, I can't see how so many people think there isn't more than just fighting Cersei.

True, Candy Land's apparent isolationism would protect them for a time... but ants – *real* ants – are nothing if not tenacious... and the realm of Gumdrop Mountains and Peanut Acres would soon be reduced to nothing more than an extended meal.

The destruction would be slow... but inevitable: Ever-increasing swarms of small, black insects – little more than an annoyance in our reality – would come to be seen as harbingers of the end days. Where we would expect the arrival of four horsemen, the denizens of Candy Land would speak in terrified whispers of the apocalyptic onslaught being wrought at the mandibles of a trillion minuscule invaders. The soil would be blighted, the natural resources would be reduced to nothing, and the infrastructure of this once-great kingdom would be consumed by the onward assault of the drones: First one by one, then two by two, the plunderers would march and wreak havoc, leaving nothing in their wake but nightmares.

LOTR and fucking Game of Thrones arent the same shit. the night king dying was the worst set up ever you dumb fuck. The difference is that sauron has been explained 5000 times in the books that he is the dark lord and he is just pure evil. But thats what Lotr is its literally just dark vs light thats what its always been. Sauron was explained to be evil just bc he wanted to control everything. BUT the fucking night king didnt fucking do anything and they hyped him up beyond levels he hasnt stated why he is coming down to kill everyone nothing was explained and got is about charecters with purpose not just evil. WTF was the point of all the symbols and prophercies if he was just gonna be killed with nothing about him explained. People didnt complain about saurons demise is because he was the last boss he was the ultimate evil and he could be killed one way and from the beginning it was obvious destroying the ring was gonna kill him. In got the night king wasnt the last boss and nothing about him was ever explained like at fuck all and he died in a way that was never expected bc it does nothing to further the story. Sauron was the big bad and him dying completed the story arc but the night king dying was pointless and now cersei has always been the big baddie wow thats soooo great fuck this shit you are blind af if you cant see all this,0

"I didn't see him return from the charge or at any other point in the battle afterwards but apparently he survived the charge.  I can only see this as possible if he actually made it through the enemies line.  It seems like after getting through the line he thought to himself 'that was fun but I'm just gonna go chill here in the woods till this is over'.  Or was he alone after making it through the lines and thought 'if I try and charge again I'm done for so I'll have to just wait it out here. Even choosing to maintain his position once the entire army of the dead was inside or on the walls of winterfell.  Does either one really make sense from a direwolf who's owner is in that battle.  It's like summer running past bran and co to be the first one out of the door.

I understand not putting him in the godswood because that meant certain death.  The logical place was guarding sansa, who is basically the stark family insurance policy in the crypts.

I’ve never denied that they’ve done some good and had some success (primarily when they decided to westernize lol) but they also do some shady af shit.

Ed: and btw the Chinese citizenry are more capitalist than Americans are (actually true) nowadays. Not to mention all the Chinese nationals who are wealthy and flee the country to safer places.

The ""Liberals"" aren't the ones trying to hide anything on this one.  This is all team Trump.  Just because the evidence by itself isn't conclusive, doesn't mean it isn't highly suggestive and doesn't mean Trump is innocent/exonerated.

"Will they? I'm not sure. Can they? Definitely. The Vikings promoted Stefanski to OC, brought in Gary Kubiak as a senior offensive advisor, and Rick Dennison as an offensive line coach/""run game coordinator"" to help us run the ball more effectively. Rick Spielman drafted offensive players in the first four rounds, and two of those players are interior offensive lineman. (Bradbury, Samia) Drafting TE Irv Smith Jr. will also result in the Vikings running more 2 TE sets which Kirk Cousins loves and will help keep Laquon Dropwell off the field. They also managed to keep most of their defensive core (Barr, Griffen) with the exception of Sheldon Richardson who was essentially a one year rental anyways.

Knowing the Vikings however, they could very easily dissapoint in a variety of ways. Kirk Cousins may continue to be anti-clutch and manage to piss off Adam Theilen even more than he already has. Our offensive line will most likely still be a work in progress or could even regress depending on how our draft picks and Josh Kline pan out. Maybe the Kevin Stefanski and Gary Kubiak experiment doesn't work out and they end up shitting the bed John Defillippo style. There's also a real chance that the Vikings defense does not return to 2017 form and is nothing more than above average despite most of our players returning. You can also never predict injuries and our season can easily get off track if any member of the o-line goes down or Kirk Cousins considering we have no viable backup options. (Sorry, Kyle Sloter doesn't count.)

I think we're on the right track but it all depends on how certain players perform and what happens next season.",0

"It's pretty clear to see why the other thread is like it is and it's down to how the question is worded. Nobody in their right mind would encourage a 12 year old to have sex toy however when you tag it onto the shaming, slamming the laptop shut and grounding the child for looking then that allows people to feel outrage which they then misdirect whether on purpose or by accidentally joining a band wagon. Even in the original question there is absolutely no indication the kid even knew what they were looking at, if they did does anyone in their right mind think they would do it in a communal area wearing headphones where they could get caught? When you view it like that it makes me wonder if that question has sinister undertones.

"I think it would have been a tough game, but not impossible. The two games in the regular season were close. Eli and Flacco showed that you can have below average offenses in the regular season, but turn it on in the post season and have a puncher's chance with anyone. It looked like Smith, Bowe, McCluster, and Avery did just that, the running game (and the time of possession that comes with it) was the missing piece that day.

Not saying any of this was guaranteed, just that this was his best shot at winning it all. If a few things went their way here or there (particularly with regards to freak injuries), there was a window of opportunity and they had a chance.",0

I went ahead and drank two cups to stay warm even though I know full well I will get sick. Sure enough, on the way home I started saying I think I am going to vomit. I was so sick. I held it in until we pulled in and then I went in the bathroom and vomited up all the contents of my stomach. I am stupid enough to do that at Trader Joe's sometimes too. They have that free sample of coffee and it smells so good. Every once in awhile I give in to temptation and drink the sample. Then all the way home I say, I am sick, I am so sick and then I get home and have to lie down for two hours until I feel better. So stupid to do this. In my defense on the night of the play, I didn't expect to vomit. Usually caffeine just makes me super nauseous but I don't usually actually vomit from it.",0

I've always thought fantasy series like HP or LoTR end way too abruptly. What is life like after such a dramatic and horrible world-threatening event (especially considering 99% of humans weren't there to witness it)? 

For me, it's extremely interesting to think about how to deal with the politics after the war. What are they going to do with the houses of the north that didn't help? What are they going to do with the South? Nobody in the south is going to believe Cersei just stood by idly while imminent doom was headed their way (had the North failed). And all the maesters in the citadel? Wtf is going to happen there? None of them believed in the WW threat... 

I mean, this is the start of a new age of lore, which is what ASOAIF is all about.

In some cases it may be justified whereas in other cases it is probably a mistake to convict such a driver. I think you get what I'm trying to say. It's often not easy to come to a decision.

Nonetheless I am adamant on my opinion that children should not be judged the same way adults are. Certainly there are always bad apples. But there are already concepts and ideas to sort these out. e.g. some countries have the children in question talk to psychiatrists to determine whether they were aware of their decisions and such. I think this is a good place to start and maybe there are even more concepts which can be applied here.",0

The need to have a ""safe alternative"" was *vastly* overstated in that thread. I've been female for 38 years and not only has it never occurred to me to use household objects, none of my friends have ever indicated it was something they did either, and I have some disgustingly honest friends.

 I don't think that it was the lack of reasonable evidence to even accuse, I think the evidence he would have needed to accuse Potus would have just further implicated the Dems/Clinton/Hussein.

They've had a ton of evidence of Russia attempting to interfere with every election since who knows when. That's an irrelevant point. The only reason it magically matters now is because someone won that they didn't want to win. 

On the other hand there is nothing to indicate whether or not their attempts actually succeeded, or if they did have a measure of success how much was due to their efforts.

"Think about it like this. The NK has NEVER even remotely dealt or even witnessed ANYTHING Braavos related. Even his human self (before he was turned) was years and years before Braavos was even founded.

The Iron Bank of Braavos has a history of using the Faceless Men to do their dirty work. They know how the Faceless men work. They have an ""in"" with the Faceless men.

So yes, it would make more sense for the Iron Bank to know what's good with Faceless men and maybe even have a counter plan...",0

"You are not a shit guy. I postponed a breakup for months. Those months were terrible, but I knew that I had to wait until she had family with her to support her during the breakup, as she had nobody where we lived and was mentally ill.  She was working on her thesis at the time, so I waited until that was done and she was visiting family.  I gave her many indications that our relationship was failing, and had been removing my things and leaving them at my parents house, but I was not going to end it until she could be held by her parents, as I knew she would not be able to take it alone. When the breakup came, she asked my why I was so distant and not wanting to talk on the phone, and I explained that I decided to break up with her. She took it very well.

A few days later she asked about setting a wedding date...Fuck. I told her I was moving out and found an apartment. She was extremely furious.

My mother still thinks I am a total asshole for how I handled it and she used to be a psychologist

My father thinks that there is no good way to do it, but I did allright, and he used to be a psychiatrist.",0

Perhaps we change the way our cities infrastructure is and ban cars instead within city limits? Seems to me that bikes and scooters and pedestrians take up considerably less space. In fact in cities that have blocked car traffic from roads have seen an increase of 60% in businesses along those roads and an uptick in pedestrians and cyclists,0
